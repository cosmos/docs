Performant, customizable, and EVM-compatible, the Cosmos stack offers builders full control of their blockchain infrastructure and implementation. Its stable and secure open-source codebase enables blockchains to achieve high throughput and fast finality.

The stack is modular: leverage pre-built components or integrate custom features for your specific use case, from consensus mechanisms to governance and compliance. The components of the stack work together to create a complete blockchain network solution that is secure, performant, scalable, and endlessly customizable.

At its core, the Cosmos stack is composed of several interoperable layers: The Cosmos SDK for application logic, CometBFT for consensus and networking, Cosmos EVM for Ethereum compatibility, and IBC for trust-minimized cross-chain communication.

Together, these components form a flexible, battle-tested stack for building interoperable blockchains without sacrificing security, customizibility, or connectivity.

## Cosmos SDK: Business Logic Layer

The Cosmos SDK is the business logic layer of the Cosmos stack. It provides a customizable base layer for building blockchains and decentralized ledgers, made up of interoperable modules that work together to define how a blockchain behaves, from accounts and transactions to tokenization, compliance, and custom application logic. Builders can compose pre-built modules and develop bespoke ones to embed their unique business logic directly into the foundation of the chain, rather than deploying it as isolated smart contracts.

This approach enables a level of customization, connectivity, and performance that traditional smart contract platforms and Layer 2 blockchains can’t offer. Developers gain access to block lifecycle hooks ([BeginBlocker and EndBlocker](/sdk/v0.53/learn/beginner/app-anatomy#beginblocker-and-endblocker)), fine-grained state separation, and scoped permissions through a security-first [Object Capability Model](/sdk/v0.53/learn/advanced/ocap). Native execution alongside [CometBFT](/cometbft/v0.38/docs/README) consensus unlocks significantly higher throughput and deterministic behavior, while upgrade tools like [Cosmovisor](/sdk/v0.53/build/cosmovisor) make chains easy to maintain and evolve over time.

## Cosmos EVM: Ethereum Compatibility Layer

Cosmos EVM enables plug-and-play Ethereum Virtual Machine compatibility for Cosmos SDK–based chains. It allows developers to deploy Solidity smart contracts, use familiar Ethereum tooling, and interact with native Cosmos modules (including IBC) through precompiles and extensions. Builders can run existing Ethereum contracts without modification while also extending the EVM with new capabilities at the chain level, enabling functionality beyond the standard EVM.

## IBC Protocol: Interoperability Layer

The Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol is part of the connectivity layer of the Cosmos stack, enabling blockchains to securely transfer tokens, messages, and arbitrary data. IBC connects independent blockchains into an interoperable network through trust-minimized communication with configurable permissioning, allowing chains to interoperate while maintaining secure, independent execution.

## CometBFT: Secure Consensus Layer

CometBFT is the consensus layer of the Cosmos stack and one of the most widely adopted, battle-tested consensus engines for building blockchains and decentralized ledger networks. It is a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) middleware that takes a deterministic state transition machine (which can be written in any programming language), and securely replicates it across a distributed set of nodes. By separating consensus from application logic, CometBFT allows developers to build custom blockchains without implementing their own networking or consensus protocols.

Responsible for proposing blocks, ordering transactions, and finalizing state transitions, CometBFT ensures that all nodes reach agreement on the canonical state of the chain. Highly performant and deterministic, it provides fast finality and can achieve throughput of up to 10,000 transactions per second (TPS), making it well-suited for high-performance, application-specific blockchains.
