Performant, customizable, and EVM-compatible, the Cosmos stack offers builders full control of their blockchain infrastructure and implementation. Its stable and secure codebase enables blockchains to achieve up to 10,000 transactions per second.

The stack is modular: leverage pre-built components or integrate custom features for your specific use case, from consensus mechanisms to governance and compliance.

Each part of the stack works together to create a complete blockchain network solution that is secure, performant, scalable, and endlessly customizable.

## Cosmos SDK: Business Logic Layer

The Cosmos SDK is the base logic layer of the chain. Working together with the CometBFT consensus engine, the Cosmos SDK provides the foundation for your blockchain’s core functions, application logic, and state management.

The Cosmos SDK is made up of modules that interoperate with each other using the SDK framework to power your blockchain. Each module has its own functionality, allowing you to fully customize any aspect of your chain. Unlike smart contract platforms where you’re constrained to execution on top of the chain, the Cosmos SDK lets you build custom business logic directly into the chain itself using [these modules](/sdk/v0.53/build/building-modules/intro). This chain-level access unlocks capabilities that are difficult or inefficient to achieve in smart-contract-only blockchain architectures:

- **Scoped and modular state management**: A modular architecture with clearly defined state boundaries helps isolate protocol components and reduce unintended interactions
- **Automated chain execution**: BeginBlocker and EndBlocker hooks run automatically with every block
- **Transaction ordering control**: Custom mempools and ABCI++ enable fine-grained control over transaction sequencing, helping mitigate front-running on critical operations
- **High-performance execution**: Native, chain-level logic enables significantly higher performance than interpreted smart contract execution

Use predefined modules for standard functionality or create custom modules for your specific use case and compliance requirements, covering permissioning, tokenization, compliance, state management, and more.

## Cosmos EVM: Ethereum Compatibility Layer

Cosmos EVM enables plug-and-play EVM compatibility for Cosmos SDK chains. Run Solidity smart contracts, access Ethereum tooling, and leverage Cosmos modules like IBC within the EVM through precompiles and extensions.

Deploy any Ethereum contract or implement new features beyond the standard EVM.

## IBC Protocol: Interoperability Layer

The Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol (IBC) is a blockchain interoperability protocol enabling blockchains to safely transfer tokens, messages, and arbitrary data. Secure and permissionless, IBC is designed to connect independent blockchains into a single interoperable network with configurable permissioning.

## CometBFT: Secure Consensus Layer

CometBFT is the most widely-adopted, battle-tested consensus engine in blockchain. It is a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) middleware that takes a state transition machine—written in any programming language—and securely replicates it across many machines.

Highly performant, CometBFT achieves speeds of up to 10,000 transactions per second (TPS).
