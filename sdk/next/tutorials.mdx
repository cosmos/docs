This guide covers everything you need to run, configure, and maintain a Cosmos SDK node. Whether you're setting up a local development node, deploying to a testnet, or running production infrastructure, you'll find step-by-step instructions and best practices. 

The node tutorial uses the `simapp` example application and its corresponding CLI binary `simd` as the blockchain application and CLI. You can view the source code for `simapp` [on GitHub](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/simapp).
