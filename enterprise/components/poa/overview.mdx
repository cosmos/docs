The Proof of Authority (PoA) module is a Cosmos SDK module that implements a permissioned consensus mechanism where a designated admin controls the validator set. Unlike traditional Proof of Stake systems, PoA validators are explicitly authorized and managed by an administrative authority rather than being selected based on staked tokens.

The PoA module is designed for networks that require:
1. **Permissioned Operators:** A configurable admin authority defines the validator set and governance participants to meet security and compliance requirements.
2. **Instant Validator Updates:** Add, remove, or replace validators, adjust relative validator weights, and rotate keys in a single on-chain action.
3. **Token-Free Operation:** Launch, operate, and govern a network without issuing a token.
4. **Future-Proof Design:** Seamlessly migrate to Proof-of-Stake security model and issue a token when needed. Additional support available from Cosmos Labs.
