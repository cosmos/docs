The Proof of Authority (PoA) module is a Cosmos SDK module that enables permissioned consensus for networks requiring controlled participation. A designated administrative authority manages the validator set directly, ensuring that only approved operators participate in block production and governance.

Unlike traditional Proof-of-Stake systems, validator membership is not determined by token staking. Validators are explicitly authorized, updated, and removed through on-chain administrative actions, enabling predictable operations and compliance-aligned governance.

The PoA module is designed for networks that require:

1. **Permissioned Operators:** A configurable administrative authority defines validators and governance participants to meet organizational security, compliance, or consortium requirements.
2. **Instant Validator Updates:** Add, remove, or replace validators, adjust relative validator weights, and rotate keys in a single atomic on-chain action.
3. **Token-Free Operation:** Launch, operate, and govern a network without issuing or managing a native token.
4. **Future-Proof Architecture:** Seamlessly transition to Proof-of-Stake and introduce a token when needed.
