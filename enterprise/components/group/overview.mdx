The Group module is a Cosmos SDK module that enables on-chain multisig accounts and collective decision-making through configurable voting policies. Any set of accounts can form a named group, attach one or more decision policies to it, and collectively authorize the execution of arbitrary messages through a proposal-and-vote workflow.

Unlike chain-wide governance proposals, group proposals are scoped to a specific group policy account — enabling organizations, DAOs, and consortiums to manage their on-chain operations with flexible, programmable authorization rules.

The Group module is designed for networks that require:

1. **Multi-Party Authorization:** Groups aggregate accounts with weighted voting power, enabling multiple parties to collectively authorize on-chain actions without relying on a single key.
2. **Flexible Decision Policies:** Each group can have multiple policy accounts with independent threshold or percentage-based rules, allowing different authorization requirements for different types of actions.
3. **Permissioned Execution:** Proposals are only executed when they meet the policy's acceptance criteria, ensuring on-chain actions reflect genuine collective agreement.
4. **DAO and Consortium Support:** Ideal for coordinating on-chain operations across organizations, multisig signers, and governance participants.
