The Cosmos Hub ("Gaia") has an on-chain governance mechanism for [signaling](/hub/v26/governance/proposal-types/text-prop), changing [consensus parameters](/hub/v26/governance/proposal-types/param-change), and spending [funds from the community pool](/hub/v26/governance/proposal-types/community-pool-spend).

This repository provides background information on these different kinds of proposals and best-practices for drafting them and proposing them on-chain.

## Community

Cosmos governance is driven by the Cosmos community, and much of the documentation in this repo was funded by the community fund itself in
[Proposal 23](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/23) and [Proposal 63](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/63).
Governance discussions happen in a number of places moderated by diverse community members, including:

* [Forum](http://forum.cosmos.network/)
* [Discord](https://discord.gg/interchain)
* [Reddit](http://reddit.com/r/cosmosnetwork)
* anywhere else you might interact with members of the Cosmos community!
