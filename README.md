# Cosmos Documentation Hub

Documentation for all parts of the Cosmos Stack.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a work in progress. More components (IBC, CometBFT, etc) will be migrated in the near future.

## Project Structure

- `docs/<product>/next/` - Active development documentation
- `docs/<product>/<version>` - Versioned documentation, by major release.
- `scripts/` - Versioning automation - see [README](/scripts).
- `snippets/` - Custom components - Due to platform limitations, components cannot be versioned. However, it is possible to feed specific / versioned data to a component through a prop in the import (see `docs/evm/v0.4.x/documentation/evm-compatibility/eip-reference.mdx` for a working example).

## Contributing

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Previous versions will only be edited under specific circumstances. All external contributions should be within the 'next' directory.
