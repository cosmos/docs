## What is Cosmos?

Cosmos is often described as the "Internet of Blockchains" – a decentralized network of blockchains
that can natively transfer assets and pass messages between one another.
Unlike monolithic or L1 >> L2 blockchain architectures, Cosmos enables the creation of fully modular and highly customizable,
 general or application-specific blockchains with complete sovereignty and a large degree of interoperability out of the box.
This comes with the benefit of a larger shared mindspace and eliminates need for external bridges and other interoperability protocols.

## Essential Concepts

Before diving deeper, ensure you understand these fundamental concepts:

### Accounts and Addresses

Cosmos uses different account types depending on the context:

- **Cosmos Addresses**: bech32-encoded addresses (e.g., `cosmos1...`)
- **EVM Addresses**: Ethereum-style hex addresses (e.g., `0x...`)
- **Validator Addresses**: Special addresses for consensus participants

### Transactions and Gas

Transactions in Cosmos work similarly to other blockchains but with some key differences:

- **Gas**: Computational units consumed by transaction execution
- **Fees**: Payment for gas, typically in the chain's native token
- **Memo**: Optional field for additional transaction data

### Governance and Upgrades

Cosmos chains can upgrade without hard forks through on-chain governance:

- **Proposals**: Community-submitted upgrade or parameter change requests
- **Voting**: Token-weighted voting by validators and delegators
- **Execution**: Automatic execution of approved proposals
