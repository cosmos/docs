## Core concepts

- **[Cosmos SDK](./sdk/)** â€“ Build sovereign, application-specific blockchains in Go with a modular architecture.
- **[Cosmos EVM](./evm/)** â€“ Deploy Solidity smart contracts that inter-operate natively with Cosmos.
- **[IBC Protocol](./ibc/)** â€“ Secure, trust-minimised cross-chain communication.

## Quickâ€‘start guides *(more coming soon)*

* [Deploy your first smart contract](./evm/quickstart)
* [Build a Cosmos app](./sdk/quickstart)
* [Set up an IBC connection](./ibc/quickstart)
* [Explore the ecosystem](./ecosystem)
