# Cosmos SDK

:::caution ðŸš§ Docs under construction
Comprehensive SDK documentation is in progress. Weâ€™re publishing sections incrementallyâ€”watch [#docs-updates](https://discord.gg/cosmosnetwork) for announcements.

## Quick overview

The Cosmos SDK is a framework for building **applicationâ€‘specific** blockchains. Unlike virtualâ€‘machine chains, every SDKâ€‘based chain controls its own state machine, governance, and upgrade path.

### Key benefits

- **Modularity** â€“ pick only the components you need.  
- **Sovereignty** â€“ full control over logic and governance.  
- **Performance** â€“ optimise for your app, *or* serve a general-purpose.  
- **Interoperability** â€“ outâ€‘ofâ€‘theâ€‘box interchain connectivity.
