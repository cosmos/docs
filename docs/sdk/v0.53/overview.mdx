## What is the Cosmos SDK

The [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) is a framework that facilitates the development of secure state machines on top of CometBFT. At its core, the SDK is a boilerplate implementation of the ABCI in Go. It comes with a `multistore` to persist data and a `router` to handle transactions.

The SDK design is based on the following principles:

- **Composability**: Build custom blockchains by composing different modules
- **Capabilities**: Object-capability model for secure inter-module interactions
- **Flexibility**: Choose consensus engines, customize modules, and configure parameters
- **Sovereignty**: Full control over your blockchain's governance and economics

## Architecture Overview

The Cosmos SDK follows a modular architecture where functionality is organized into discrete modules:

- **Core Modules**: Essential modules like `auth`, `bank`, `staking`, and `gov`
- **IBC Modules**: Enable cross-chain communication and asset transfers
- **Custom Modules**: Build your own modules for application-specific logic
- **Keeper Pattern**: Encapsulate module state and expose controlled interfaces

Learn more about the [SDK architecture](/docs/sdk/v0.53/core-concepts/baseapp) and [module system](/docs/sdk/v0.53/building-modules/intro).
