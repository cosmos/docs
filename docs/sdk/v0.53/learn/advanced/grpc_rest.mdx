title: 'gRPC, REST, and CometBFT Endpoints'
---

<Note>
**Synopsis**
This document presents an overview of all the endpoints a node exposes: gRPC, REST as well as some other endpoints.
</Note>

## An Overview of All Endpoints

Each node exposes the following endpoints for users to interact with a node, each endpoint is served on a different port. Details on how to configure each endpoint is provided in the endpoint's own section.

* the gRPC server (default port: `9090`),
* the REST server (default port: `1317`),
* the CometBFT RPC endpoint (default port: `26657`).

<Tip>
The node also exposes some other endpoints, such as the CometBFT P2P endpoint, or the [Prometheus endpoint](https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.37/core/metrics), which are not directly related to the Cosmos SDK. Please refer to the [CometBFT documentation](https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.37/core/configuration) for more information about these endpoints.
</Tip>

<Note>
All endpoints are defaulted to localhost and must be modified to be exposed to the public internet.

## gRPC Server

In the Cosmos SDK, Protobuf is the main [encoding](/docs/sdk/v0.53/encoding) library. This brings a wide range of Protobuf-based tools that can be plugged into the Cosmos SDK. One such tool is [gRPC](https://grpc.io), a modern open-source high performance RPC framework that has decent client support in several languages.

Each module exposes a [Protobuf `Query` service](/docs/sdk/v0.53//build/building-modules/messages-and-queries#queries) that defines state queries. The `Query` services and a transaction service used to broadcast transactions are hooked up to the gRPC server via the following function inside the application:

```go expandable
package types

import (
    
	"encoding/json"
    "io"

	cmtproto "github.com/cometbft/cometbft/proto/tendermint/types"
	cmttypes "github.com/cometbft/cometbft/types"
	dbm "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-db"

)

type (
	// AppOptions defines an interface that is passed into an application
	// constructor, typically used to set BaseApp options that are either supplied
	// via config file or through CLI arguments/flags. The underlying implementation
	// is defined by the server package and is typically implemented via a Viper
	// literal defined on the server Context. Note, casting Get calls may not yield
	// the expected types and could result in type assertion errors. It is recommend
	// to either use the cast package or perform manual conversion for safety.
	AppOptions interface {
    Get(string)

interface{
}
	
}

	// Application defines an application interface that wraps abci.Application.
	// The interface defines the necessary contracts to be implemented in order
	// to fully bootstrap and start an application.
	Application interface {
    ABCI

		RegisterAPIRoutes(*api.Server, config.APIConfig)

		// RegisterGRPCServerWithSkipCheckHeader registers gRPC services directly with the gRPC
		// server and bypass check header flag.
		RegisterGRPCServerWithSkipCheckHeader(grpc.Server, bool)

		// RegisterTxService registers the gRPC Query service for tx (such as tx
		// simulation, fetching txs by hash...).
		RegisterTxService(client.Context)

		// RegisterTendermintService registers the gRPC Query service for CometBFT queries.
		RegisterTendermintService(client.Context)

		// RegisterNodeService registers the node gRPC Query service.
		RegisterNodeService(client.Context, config.Config)

		// CommitMultiStore return the multistore instance
		CommitMultiStore()

storetypes.CommitMultiStore

		// Return the snapshot manager
		SnapshotManager() *snapshots.Manager

		// Close is called in start cmd to gracefully cleanup resources.
		// Must be safe to be called multiple times.
		Close()

error
}

	// AppCreator is a function that allows us to lazily initialize an
	// application using various configurations.
	AppCreator func(log.Logger, dbm.DB, io.Writer, AppOptions)

Application

	// ModuleInitFlags takes a start command and adds modules specific init flags.
	ModuleInitFlags func(startCmd *cobra.Command)

	// ExportedApp represents an exported app state, along with
	// validators, consensus params and latest app height.
	ExportedApp struct {
		// AppState is the application state as JSON.
		AppState json.RawMessage
		// Validators is the exported validator set.
		Validators []cmttypes.GenesisValidator
		// Height is the app's latest block height.
		Height int64
		// ConsensusParams are the exported consensus params for ABCI.
		ConsensusParams cmtproto.ConsensusParams
}

	// AppExporter is a function that dumps all app state to
	// JSON-serializable structure and returns the current validator set.
	AppExporter func(
		logger log.Logger,
		db dbm.DB,
		traceWriter io.Writer,
		height int64,
    forZeroHeight bool,
		jailAllowedAddrs []string,
		opts AppOptions,
		modulesToExport []string,
	) (ExportedApp, error)
)
```

Note: It is not possible to expose any [Protobuf `Msg` service](/docs/sdk/v0.53//build/building-modules/messages-and-queries#messages) endpoints via gRPC. Transactions must be generated and signed using the CLI or programmatically before they can be broadcasted using gRPC. See [Generating, Signing, and Broadcasting Transactions](/docs/sdk/v0.53//user/run-node/txs) for more information.

The `grpc.Server` is a concrete gRPC server, which spawns and serves all gRPC query requests and a broadcast transaction request. This server can be configured inside `~/.simapp/config/app.toml`:

* `grpc.enable = true|false` field defines if the gRPC server should be enabled. Defaults to `true`.
* `grpc.address = {string}` field defines the `ip:port` the server should bind to. Defaults to `localhost:9090`.

<Tip>
`~/.simapp` is the directory where the node's configuration and databases are stored. By default, it's set to `~/.{app_name}`.
</Tip>

Once the gRPC server is started, you can send requests to it using a gRPC client. Some examples are given in our [Interact with the Node](/docs/sdk/v0.53//user/run-node/interact-node#using-grpc) tutorial.

An overview of all available gRPC endpoints shipped with the Cosmos SDK is [Protobuf documentation](https://buf.build/cosmos/cosmos-sdk).

## REST Server

Cosmos SDK supports REST routes via gRPC-gateway.

All routes are configured under the following fields in `~/.simapp/config/app.toml`:

* `api.enable = true|false` field defines if the REST server should be enabled. Defaults to `false`.
* `api.address = {string}` field defines the `ip:port` the server should bind to. Defaults to `tcp://localhost:1317`.
* some additional API configuration options are defined in `~/.simapp/config/app.toml`, along with comments, please refer to that file directly.

### gRPC-gateway REST Routes

If, for various reasons, you cannot use gRPC (for example, you are building a web application, and browsers don't support HTTP2 on which gRPC is built), then the Cosmos SDK offers REST routes via gRPC-gateway.

[gRPC-gateway](https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/) is a tool to expose gRPC endpoints as REST endpoints. For each gRPC endpoint defined in a Protobuf `Query` service, the Cosmos SDK offers a REST equivalent. For instance, querying a balance could be done via the `/cosmos.bank.v1beta1.QueryAllBalances` gRPC endpoint, or alternatively via the gRPC-gateway `"/cosmos/bank/v1beta1/balances/{address}"` REST endpoint: both will return the same result. For each RPC method defined in a Protobuf `Query` service, the corresponding REST endpoint is defined as an option:

```protobuf
// Reference: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.53.0-rc.2/proto/cosmos/bank/v1beta1/query.proto#L23-L30
```

For application developers, gRPC-gateway REST routes needs to be wired up to the REST server, this is done by calling the `RegisterGRPCGatewayRoutes` function on the ModuleManager.

### Swagger

A [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) (or OpenAPIv2) specification file is exposed under the `/swagger` route on the API server. Swagger is an open specification describing the API endpoints a server serves, including description, input arguments, return types and much more about each endpoint.

Enabling the `/swagger` endpoint is configurable inside `~/.simapp/config/app.toml` via the `api.swagger` field, which is set to false by default.

For application developers, you may want to generate your own Swagger definitions based on your custom modules.
The Cosmos SDK's [Swagger generation script](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.53.0-rc.2/scripts/protoc-swagger-gen.sh) is a good place to start.

## CometBFT RPC

Independently from the Cosmos SDK, CometBFT also exposes a RPC server. This RPC server can be configured by tuning parameters under the `rpc` table in the `~/.simapp/config/config.toml`, the default listening address is `tcp://localhost:26657`. An OpenAPI specification of all CometBFT RPC endpoints is available [here](https://docs.cometbft.com/main/rpc/).

Some CometBFT RPC endpoints are directly related to the Cosmos SDK:

* `/abci_query`: this endpoint will query the application for state. As the `path` parameter, you can send the following strings:
  * any Protobuf fully-qualified service method, such as `/cosmos.bank.v1beta1.Query/AllBalances`. The `data` field should then include the method's request parameter(s) encoded as bytes using Protobuf.
  * `/app/simulate`: this will simulate a transaction, and return some information such as gas used.
  * `/app/version`: this will return the application's version.
  * `/store/{storeName}/key`: this will directly query the named store for data associated with the key represented in the `data` parameter.
  * `/store/{storeName}/subspace`: this will directly query the named store for key/value pairs in which the key has the value of the `data` parameter as a prefix.
  * `/p2p/filter/addr/{port}`: this will return a filtered list of the node's P2P peers by address port.
  * `/p2p/filter/id/{id}`: this will return a filtered list of the node's P2P peers by ID.
* `/broadcast_tx_{sync,async,commit}`: these 3 endpoints will broadcast a transaction to other peers. CLI, gRPC and REST expose [a way to broadcast transactions](/docs/sdk/v0.53/transactions#broadcasting-the-transaction), but they all use these 3 CometBFT RPCs under the hood.
