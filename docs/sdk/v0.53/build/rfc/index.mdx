# Requests for Comments (RFCs)

Requests for Comments (RFCs) are historical records of design discussions on open-ended topics related to the Cosmos SDK. **Note: These are not current policies or procedures that are actively adhered to today**, but serve as historical documentation of past design discussions and exploration.

## What are RFCs?

An **RFC (Request for Comments)** is a record of discussion on an open-ended topic related to the design and implementation of the Cosmos SDK, for which no immediate decision is required.

### Key Characteristics

- **Historical discussion records**: Captures high-level design discussions that might otherwise be lost
- **Async whiteboarding**: Replaces the need for distributed teams to synchronously decide
- **Exploration tool**: Used when you need to explore a topic and gather input to determine what questions need answering
- **Precursor to ADRs**: Often leads to more specific architectural decisions documented in ADRs

## RFC vs ADR

The Cosmos SDK uses two complementary documentation approaches:

| Aspect | RFC | ADR |
|--------|-----|-----|
| **Purpose** | Explore topics, gather input | Document specific decisions |
| **Scope** | Open-ended discussion | Concrete architectural choice |
| **Timing** | Before decisions are made | After decisions are reached |
| **Output** | Understanding and questions | Implemented architecture |

**Rule of thumb:**
- **Write an RFC** if you need to explore a topic and get input to know what questions need answering
- **Write an ADR** if you can articulate a specific question that needs to be answered

## RFC Process (Historical)

The historical RFC creation process involved:

1. **Draft creation**: Copy the RFC template with pattern `rfc-next_number-title.md`
2. **Early feedback**: Create draft Pull Request for initial input
3. **Iteration**: Refine based on community discussion
4. **Documentation**: Ensure context and solutions are well documented
5. **Merge decision**: Liberal merging policy - prefer to merge with status rather than abandon

### Merging Philosophy

- **Always merge**: RFCs should be merged even if ultimately rejected
- **Iterative approach**: Preferred over long, unmerged Pull Requests
- **Status tracking**: Merged with appropriate status (proposed, accepted, rejected)
- **Only exception**: Author abandonment is the only reason not to merge

## Historical Context

RFCs served as a crucial part of the Cosmos SDK's distributed development approach, allowing globally distributed teams to collaborate effectively on design discussions before moving to implementation phases.

Many significant features and architectural decisions in the Cosmos SDK began as RFC discussions, which then evolved into concrete ADRs and ultimately into implemented features.

## Browse Historical RFCs

All historical Cosmos SDK Request for Comments are maintained in the official repository:

**ðŸ“‚ [View All RFCs on GitHub](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/docs/rfc)**

This repository contains the complete collection of historical RFC discussions including:

- Proposed design explorations
- Community discussion records
- Evolution of ideas into concrete decisions
- RFC templates and creation guidelines

## Current Development Process

For current development and design discussions, refer to:

- **GitHub Issues**: For feature requests and bug discussions
- **GitHub Discussions**: For community design conversations
- **Architecture Decision Records**: For concrete architectural decisions
- **Working Groups**: For synchronous design collaboration

The RFC process represents an important part of the SDK's historical development methodology and provides valuable insight into how major features and architectural decisions evolved over time.
