# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are historical documentation of architectural decisions and design choices in the Cosmos SDK. **Note: These are not current policies or procedures that are actively adhered to today**, but rather serve as historical reference for understanding past design decisions.

## What are ADRs?

An **Architecture Decision Record (ADR)** captures a single architectural decision, providing context, intuition, reasoning, and justification for changes in architecture or for the architecture of something new.

### Key Characteristics

- **Historical record**: Documents high-level architecture decisions for future reference
- **Design rationale**: Explains the "why" behind architectural choices
- **Community input**: Serves as a focal point for collecting feedback on proposed changes
- **Decision log**: The collection of ADRs constitutes the project's architectural decision history

### ADR vs Specification

**ADR**: Comprehensive discussion of architectural decisions with context and reasoning
**Specification**: Compressed, streamlined summary of the current state as implemented

## ADR Process

The ADR creation process follows these steps:

1. **Identify the need**: Recognize when an architectural decision needs documentation
2. **Draft the ADR**: Use the standard template to structure the decision
3. **Community review**: Gather input and feedback from the community
4. **Iterate and refine**: Update the ADR based on feedback
5. **Final decision**: Accept, reject, or defer the architectural decision

## ADR Categories

ADRs in the Cosmos SDK typically cover:

- **Core protocol changes**: Modifications to fundamental blockchain mechanics
- **Module architecture**: Design decisions for specific SDK modules
- **API design**: Changes to public interfaces and APIs
- **Performance optimizations**: Architectural decisions for improved performance
- **Security enhancements**: Security-focused architectural changes
- **Developer experience**: Improvements to SDK usability and tooling

## Browse All ADRs

All Cosmos SDK Architecture Decision Records are maintained in the official repository:

**ðŸ“‚ [View All ADRs on GitHub](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/docs/architecture)**

This repository contains the complete, up-to-date collection of all architectural decisions including:

- Current ADRs under review
- Accepted architectural decisions
- Historical decisions and their evolution
- ADR templates for creating new proposals

## Notable ADR Examples

Some significant architectural decisions documented in ADRs include:

- **State management**: Decisions about state store design and access patterns
- **Transaction processing**: Architecture for transaction lifecycle and processing
- **Module system**: Design of the modular architecture framework
- **Consensus integration**: Architectural decisions for consensus engine integration
- **Protobuf adoption**: Migration to Protocol Buffers for serialization

## Contributing to ADRs

To propose a new ADR or contribute to existing discussions:

1. **Review existing ADRs**: Check if your topic is already covered
2. **Follow the template**: Use the standard ADR template structure
3. **Create a proposal**: Submit a pull request with your ADR draft
4. **Engage with feedback**: Participate in the review and discussion process
