# User Guides

Practical guides for operating and interacting with Cosmos SDK blockchain applications, from key management to production deployment.

## Node Operations

Everything you need to know about running and managing blockchain nodes in various environments.

### Key Management

- **[Setting up the Keyring](run-node/keyring.mdx)** - Configure secure key management using the Cosmos SDK's keyring system with support for multiple backends including OS keychains, file-based storage, and hardware wallets

### Running Nodes

- **[Running a Node](run-node/run-node.mdx)** - Complete guide to initializing, configuring, and running a blockchain node including genesis setup, peer configuration, and state sync
- **[Running in Production](run-node/run-production.mdx)** - Best practices and considerations for operating nodes in production environments including security, monitoring, and performance optimization
- **[Running a Testnet](run-node/run-testnet.mdx)** - Set up and participate in testnets for development and testing purposes

### Interacting with Nodes

- **[Interacting with a Node](run-node/interact-node.mdx)** - Use the CLI to query state, submit transactions, and manage your node through various commands and operations
- **[Generating & Signing Transactions](run-node/txs.mdx)** - Create, sign, and broadcast transactions programmatically or through the CLI, including multi-signature transactions

### Integration Tools

- **[Rosetta API](run-node/rosetta.mdx)** - Implement the Rosetta API standard for blockchain integration, enabling exchanges and other services to interact with your chain using a standardized interface

## Guide Categories

### ðŸ”‘ **Security & Keys**
Start with proper key management - the foundation of blockchain security. Learn about different keyring backends and best practices for key storage.

### ðŸš€ **Node Deployment**
Progress from local development to production deployment. Understand the full lifecycle of running blockchain infrastructure.

### ðŸ”§ **Operations & Maintenance**
Master day-to-day operations including monitoring, upgrades, and troubleshooting common issues.

### ðŸ”Œ **Integration**
Connect your blockchain to external services using standard APIs and interfaces.

## Prerequisites

Before using these guides, ensure you have:

- Built your blockchain application binary
- Basic understanding of blockchain concepts
- Access to a terminal/command line
- Appropriate system permissions for your deployment environment

## Common Workflows

### Setting Up a New Node

1. **Configure Keyring** - Set up secure key storage
2. **Initialize Chain** - Create genesis and configuration files
3. **Configure Peers** - Connect to other nodes in the network
4. **Start Node** - Begin syncing and participating in consensus

### Interacting with a Running Chain

1. **Query State** - Retrieve current blockchain data
2. **Create Transaction** - Build a new transaction
3. **Sign Transaction** - Use keyring to sign
4. **Broadcast** - Submit to the network

### Production Deployment

1. **Security Hardening** - Configure firewalls and access controls
2. **Monitoring Setup** - Implement logging and metrics
3. **Backup Strategy** - Regular state backups
4. **Upgrade Planning** - Prepare for chain upgrades

Each guide includes detailed commands, configuration examples, and troubleshooting tips to ensure successful deployment and operation of your Cosmos SDK application.
