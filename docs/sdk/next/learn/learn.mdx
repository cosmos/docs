# Learn Cosmos SDK

Welcome to the learning section of the Cosmos SDK documentation. This comprehensive guide will take you from foundational concepts to advanced implementation details, helping you understand how to build custom application-specific blockchains.

## Introduction

Start your journey by understanding what the Cosmos SDK is and why it's revolutionary for blockchain development:

- **[What is the Cosmos SDK](intro/overview.mdx)** - Discover the open-source toolkit for building multi-asset public Proof-of-Stake blockchains and understand the concept of modularity in blockchain architecture
- **[Why Application-Specific Blockchains](intro/why-app-specific.mdx)** - Learn why building dedicated blockchains for specific applications provides better sovereignty, security, and performance compared to smart contracts
- **[SDK Application Architecture](intro/sdk-app-architecture.mdx)** - Explore the technical architecture of a Cosmos SDK application, including state machines, CometBFT consensus, and the ABCI interface
- **[SDK Design Overview](intro/sdk-design.mdx)** - Understand the core design principles and patterns that make the Cosmos SDK secure, flexible, and developer-friendly

## Beginner Concepts

Build your foundation with these essential concepts that every Cosmos SDK developer needs to understand:

- **[Anatomy of an Application](beginner/app-anatomy.mdx)** - Learn about the core components of a Cosmos SDK application including the node client, app structure, and how they interact
- **[Accounts](beginner/accounts.mdx)** - Understand how accounts work in Cosmos SDK, including addresses, key management, and account types
- **[Transaction Lifecycle](beginner/tx-lifecycle.mdx)** - Follow a transaction from creation through execution, learning about each stage of processing
- **[Query Lifecycle](beginner/query-lifecycle.mdx)** - Discover how queries are processed to retrieve blockchain state information
- **[Gas and Fees](beginner/gas-fees.mdx)** - Learn about the gas system that measures computational work and how fees incentivize validators

## Advanced Topics

Dive deep into the technical implementation details and advanced features of the Cosmos SDK:

### Core Components
- **[BaseApp](advanced/baseapp.mdx)** - The foundation that implements core ABCI functionality and message routing
- **[Node Client](advanced/node.mdx)** - The full-node implementation that runs your blockchain
- **[Context](advanced/context.mdx)** - The data structure that carries state and execution information through your application
- **[Store](advanced/store.mdx)** - The persistence layer using IAVL trees and multistore architecture

### Transaction & State Management
- **[Transactions](advanced/transactions.mdx)** - Deep dive into transaction types, signing, and verification
- **[RunTx Middleware](advanced/runtx_middleware.mdx)** - Recovery mechanisms and middleware for transaction processing
- **[Events](advanced/events.mdx)** - The event system for indexing and querying blockchain activity

### APIs & Interfaces
- **[gRPC & REST](advanced/grpc_rest.mdx)** - Query and transaction endpoints for client interaction
- **[CLI](advanced/cli.mdx)** - Command-line interface for interacting with your blockchain
- **[AutoCLI](advanced/autocli.mdx)** - Automatic CLI generation from protobuf definitions

### Development Tools
- **[Encoding](advanced/encoding.mdx)** - Protobuf encoding and amino codec details
- **[Simulation](advanced/simulation.mdx)** - Testing framework for simulating blockchain operations
- **[Telemetry](advanced/telemetry.mdx)** - Metrics and monitoring for production deployments
- **[Configuration](advanced/config.mdx)** - Application and node configuration options

### Security & Upgrades
- **[Object-Capability Model](advanced/ocap.mdx)** - Security model for safe inter-module communication
- **[Upgrades](advanced/upgrade.mdx)** - On-chain upgrade mechanisms for evolving your blockchain
- **[Protobuf Documentation](advanced/proto-docs.mdx)** - Understanding and working with protocol buffer definitions

## Learning Path

1. **Start with Introduction** - Understand the big picture and why Cosmos SDK exists
2. **Master Beginner Concepts** - Build a solid foundation with core concepts
3. **Explore Advanced Topics** - Dive into specific areas based on your needs
4. **Build Your Application** - Apply your knowledge to create custom blockchain solutions

Each section builds upon the previous one, but experienced developers can jump directly to topics of interest. The modular nature of the Cosmos SDK means you can focus on the components most relevant to your use case.
