This document explains the various protobuf scalars that have been added to make working with protobuf easier for Cosmos SDK application developers

## Signer

Signer specifies which field should be used to determine the signer of a message for the Cosmos SDK. This field can be used for clients as well to infer which field should be used to determine the signer of a message.

Read more about the signer field [here](/docs/sdk/next/documentation/module-system/messages-and-queries).

```protobuf
  option (cosmos.msg.v1.signer) = "from_address";
```

```proto
option (cosmos.msg.v1.signer) = "from_address";
```

## Scalar

The scalar type defines a way for clients to understand how to construct protobuf messages according to what is expected by the module and sdk.

```proto
(cosmos_proto.scalar) = "cosmos.AddressString"
```

Example of account address string scalar:

```proto
  string   from_address                    = 1 [(cosmos_proto.scalar) = "cosmos.AddressString"];
```

Example of validator address string scalar:

```proto
  string validator_address = 1 [(cosmos_proto.scalar) = "cosmos.ValidatorAddressString"];
```

Example of Decimals scalar:

```proto
    (cosmos_proto.scalar)  = "cosmos.Dec",
```

Example of Int scalar:

```proto
  string yes_count = 1 [(cosmos_proto.scalar) = "cosmos.Int"];
```

There are a few options for what can be provided as a scalar: `cosmos.AddressString`, `cosmos.ValidatorAddressString`, `cosmos.ConsensusAddressString`, `cosmos.Int`, `cosmos.Dec`.

## Implements\_Interface

`Implements_Interface` is used to provide information to client tooling like [telescope](https://github.com/cosmology-tech/telescope) on how to encode and decode protobuf messages.

```proto
option (cosmos_proto.implements_interface) = "cosmos.auth.v1beta1.AccountI";
```

## Method,Field,Message Added In

`method_added_in`, `field_added_in` and `message_added_in` are annotations to denote to clients that a field has been supported in a later version. This is useful when new methods or fields are added in later versions and that the client needs to be aware of what it can call.

The annotation should be worded as follows:

```proto
option (cosmos_proto.method_added_in) = "cosmos-sdk v0.50.1";
option (cosmos_proto.method_added_in) = "x/epochs v1.0.0";
option (cosmos_proto.method_added_in) = "simapp v24.0.0";
```

## Amino

The amino codec was removed in `v0.50+`, this means there is no need to register `legacyAminoCodec`. To replace the amino codec, Amino protobuf annotations are used to provide information to the amino codec on how to encode and decode protobuf messages.

Amino annotations are only used for backwards compatibility with amino. New modules are not required to use amino annotations.

The below annotations are used to provide information to the amino codec on how to encode and decode protobuf messages in a backwards compatible manner.

### Name

Name specifies the amino name that would show up for the user in order for them to see which message they are signing.

```proto
option (amino.name) = "cosmos-sdk/BaseAccount";
```

```proto
  option (amino.name)           = "cosmos-sdk/MsgSend";
```

### Field\_Name

Field name specifies the amino name that would show up for the user in order for them to see which field they are signing.

```proto
uint64 height = 1 [(amino.field_name) = "public_key"];
```

```proto
      [(gogoproto.jsontag) = "creation_height", (amino.field_name) = "creation_height", (amino.dont_omitempty) = true];
```

### Dont\_OmitEmpty

Dont omitempty specifies that the field should not be omitted when encoding to amino.

```proto
repeated cosmos.base.v1beta1.Coin amount = 3 [(amino.dont_omitempty)   = true];
```

```proto
    (amino.dont_omitempty)   = true,
```

### Encoding

Encoding instructs the amino json marshaler how to encode certain fields that may differ from the standard encoding behaviour. The most common example of this is how `repeated cosmos.base.v1beta1.Coin` is encoded when using the amino json encoding format. The `legacy_coins` option tells the json marshaler [how to encode a null slice](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/e8f28bf5db18b8d6b7e0d94b542ce4cf48fed9d6/x/tx/signing/aminojson/json_marshal.go#L65) of `cosmos.base.v1beta1.Coin`.

```proto
(amino.encoding)         = "legacy_coins",
```

```proto
    (amino.encoding)         = "legacy_coins",
```
