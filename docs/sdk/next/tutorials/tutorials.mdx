# Cosmos SDK Tutorials

Hands-on tutorials to help you master key concepts and advanced features of the Cosmos SDK through practical examples and real-world implementations.

## Transaction Building

Learn the fundamentals of creating, signing, and broadcasting transactions in Cosmos SDK applications:

- **[Building a Transaction](transactions/building-a-transaction.mdx)** - Step-by-step guide to construct, sign, and broadcast transactions using v2 semantics, including proper imports, keyring setup, and transaction configuration

## Vote Extensions

Master one of the most powerful consensus features in Cosmos SDK - vote extensions that allow validators to include additional data during the consensus process.

### Oracle Implementation

Build a decentralized oracle system using vote extensions to bring external data on-chain:

- **[What is an Oracle?](vote-extensions/oracle/what-is-an-oracle.mdx)** - Understand the role of oracles in blockchain and how they enable smart contracts to interact with external data
- **[Getting Started](vote-extensions/oracle/getting-started.mdx)** - Set up your development environment and scaffold the oracle module
- **[Implementing Vote Extensions](vote-extensions/oracle/implementing-vote-extensions.mdx)** - Learn how to implement vote extensions to submit oracle data during consensus
- **[Testing Oracle](vote-extensions/oracle/testing-oracle.mdx)** - Write comprehensive tests to ensure your oracle implementation works correctly

### Mitigating Front-Running in Auctions

Implement advanced MEV protection using vote extensions to create fair auction systems:

- **[Understanding Front-Running](vote-extensions/auction-frontrunning/understanding-frontrunning.mdx)** - Learn about MEV, front-running attacks, and their impact on auction fairness
- **[Getting Started](vote-extensions/auction-frontrunning/getting-started.mdx)** - Set up the auction module with front-running protection capabilities
- **[Mitigating Front-Running with Vote Extensions](vote-extensions/auction-frontrunning/mitigating-front-running-with-vote-extensions.mdx)** - Implement commit-reveal schemes and encrypted bids using vote extensions
- **[Demo of Mitigating Front-Running](vote-extensions/auction-frontrunning/demo-of-mitigating-front-running.mdx)** - See the anti-front-running mechanism in action with a complete demonstration

## Prerequisites

Before starting these tutorials, ensure you have:

- Basic understanding of Cosmos SDK concepts (review the [Learn](../learn/learn.mdx) section)
- Go programming language knowledge
- Development environment set up with Go 1.21+
- Familiarity with blockchain concepts and consensus mechanisms

## Learning Path

1. **Start with Transactions** - Master the basics of building and submitting transactions
2. **Explore Vote Extensions** - Understand how to extend consensus with additional data
3. **Build Real Applications** - Apply your knowledge to create oracles or auction systems
4. **Experiment and Extend** - Use these patterns to build your own innovative features

Each tutorial includes complete code examples, explanations of key concepts, and testing strategies to ensure your implementations are production-ready.
