## Overview

This guide walks you through **deploying, configuring and extending** the open-source Cosmos EVM faucet.  The same workflow applies to *any* dApp back-end / smart-contract project, so it is an ideal first stop for new builders.


## Prerequisites

| Tool | Version used in screenshots | Notes |
| ---- | --------------------------- | ----- |
| Node.js | ≥ 18.x (examples use **v22.14.0**) | JavaScript runtime |
| Foundry | ≥ 1.2.3-stable | Solidity build / deployment |
| Git | latest | To clone & fork |
| curl | any | Quick RPC tests |

Make sure the **Gaia EVM Devnet** RPC endpoint is reachable:

```bash
curl -s https://devnet-1-evmrpc.ib.skip.build \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_chainId","params":[],"id":1}'
# → {"result":"0x10e1"}
```

## Cloning & Setup

```bash
# 1. Fork the repository in GitHub, then clone your fork
$ git clone https://github.com/<your-handle>/faucet.git
$ cd faucet

# 2. Install dependencies
$ yarn install   # or npm ci

# 3. Copy .env.sample → .env and insert your private key
$ cp .env.sample .env
$ $EDITOR .env

# 4. Build contracts (optional – they are pre-compiled)
$ forge build
```

Now jump to **Back-End** ↓ to learn how the Node service talks to the contracts, or straight to **Front-End** if you want to hack on the UI first.
