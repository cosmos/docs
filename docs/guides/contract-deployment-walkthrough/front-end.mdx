## Which Platform To Use?

## Common Libraries & Best Practices

## UX & Security Considerations

## Theme & Design

## Overview

The faucet comes with a minimal **Vue 3** single-page application that lives inside the same repository.  It demonstrates how to:

* Detect the user's wallet (MetaMask / Keplr)
* Switch the wallet to the Gaia EVM Devnet chain
* Wrap & unwrap native ATOM into ERC-20 WATOM
* Request a multi-token airdrop with a single click

You can replace Vue with React or Svelteâ€”the on-chain calls are plain **ethers.js 6**.

## Wallet Connector

`views/Home.vue` mounts a reusable `WalletButton` component that:
1. Checks for `window.ethereum` (MetaMask) or `window.keplr` (Cosmos wallets)
2. Suggests the Devnet chain if it's missing (using `wallet_addEthereumChain`)
3. Stores the selected address in Vuex so every component can access it

> **Tip for your own dApps**: separate the *"ensure we're on the right network"* logic into a composable (e.g. `useEvmNetwork.ts`) so you can re-use it across pages.

## Calling the Back-End

```ts
await fetch(`/send/${address}`)
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(({ txHash }) => console.log('airdrop tx', txHash));
```
The API is hard-coded to the same origin so you can deploy both front- & back-end on a single Vercel / Netlify site.

## WATOM Wrap / Unwrap

```ts
const werc20 = new ethers.Contract(
  '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000802',
  ['function deposit() payable',
   'function withdraw(uint256)'],
  signer);

// Wrap 1 ATOM
await werc20.deposit({ value: ethers.parseEther('1') });

// Unwrap everything
const bal = await werc20.balanceOf(address);
await werc20.withdraw(bal);
```
The UI shows both balances side-by-side so the user can verify the 1:1 ratio.

## Styling & UX

The demo uses **Bootstrap 5** + a custom Cosmos colour palette.  Feel free to swap it out; none of the logic depends on the CSS framework.

* Disable the **Send** button while a request is in-flight.
* Show the tx-hash with a link to the Devnet block-explorer.
* Use `localStorage` to remember the preferred wallet.

## Next Steps

1. Add a **Progressive Web App** manifest so users can install the faucet.
2. Package the wallet connector as an NPM module and share it across projects.
3. Replace Bootstrap with Tailwind for smaller bundle size.
