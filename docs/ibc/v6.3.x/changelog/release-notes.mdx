- (apps/transfer) [\#2446](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/2446) Remove `SendTransfer` function in favor of a private `sendTransfer` function. All IBC transfers must be initiated with `MsgTransfer`.
- (apps/29-fee) [\#2395](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/2395) Remove param space from ics29 NewKeeper function. The field was unused.
- (apps/27-interchain-accounts) [\#2133](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/2133) Generates genesis protos in a separate directory to avoid circular import errors. The protobuf package name has changed for the genesis types.
- (apps/27-interchain-accounts) [\#2638](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/2638) Interchain accounts host and controller Keepers now expects a keeper which fulfills the expected `exported.ScopedKeeper` interface for the capability keeper.
- (transfer) [\#2638](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/2638) Transfer Keeper now expects a keeper which fulfills the expected `exported.ScopedKeeper` interface for the capability keeper.
- (05-port) [\#2638](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/2638) Port Keeper now expects a keeper which fulfills the expected `exported.ScopedKeeper` interface for the capability keeper.
- (04-channel) [\#2638](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/2638) Channel Keeper now expects a keeper which fulfills the expected `exported.ScopedKeeper` interface for the capability keeper.
- (core/04-channel)[\#1703](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/1703) Update `SendPacket` API to take in necessary arguments and construct rest of packet rather than taking in entire packet. The generated packet sequence is returned by the `SendPacket` function.

- (testing) [\#2567](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/2567) Modify `SendPacket` API of `Endpoint` to match the API of `SendPacket` in 04-channel.

## State Machine Breaking

- (apps/transfer) [\#2651](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/2651) Introduce `mustProtoMarshalJSON` for ics20 packet data marshalling which will skip emission (marshalling) of the memo field if unpopulated (empty).
- (27-interchain-accounts) [\#2590](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/2590) Removing port prefix requirement from the ICA host channel handshake
- (transfer) [\#2377](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/2377) Adding `sequence` to `MsgTransferResponse`.

## Improvements

- (apps/27-interchain-accounts) [\#2134](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/2134) Adding upgrade handler to ICS27 `controller` submodule for migration of channel capabilities. This upgrade handler migrates ownership of channel capabilities from the underlying application to the ICS27 `controller` submodule.
- (apps/27-interchain-accounts) [\#2102](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/2102) ICS27 controller middleware now supports a nil underlying application. This allows chains to make use of interchain accounts with existing auth mechanisms such as x/group and x/gov.
- (apps/27-interchain-accounts) [\#2157](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/2157) Adding `IsMiddlewareEnabled` functionality to enforce calls to ICS27 msg server to *not* route to the underlying application.
- (apps/27-interchain-accounts) [\#2146](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/2146) ICS27 controller now claims the channel capability passed via ibc core, and passes `nil` to the underlying app callback. The channel capability arg in `SendTx` is now ignored and looked up internally.
- (apps/27-interchain-accounts) [\#2177](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/2177) Adding `IsMiddlewareEnabled` flag to interchain accounts `ActiveChannel` genesis type.
- (apps/27-interchain-accounts) [\#2140](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/2140) Adding migration handler to ICS27 `controller` submodule to assert ownership of channel capabilities and set middleware enabled flag for existing channels. The ICS27 module consensus version has been bumped from 1 to 2.
- (core/04-channel) [\#2304](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/2304) Adding `GetAllChannelsWithPortPrefix` function which filters channels based on a provided port prefix.
- (apps/27-interchain-accounts) [\#2248](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/2248) Adding call to underlying app in `OnChanCloseConfirm` callback of the controller submodule and adding relevant unit tests.
- (apps/27-interchain-accounts) [\#2251](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/2251) Adding `msgServer` struct to controller submodule that embeds the `Keeper` struct.
- (apps/27-interchain-accounts) [\#2290](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/2290) Changed `DefaultParams` function in `host` submodule to allow all messages by default. Defined a constant named `AllowAllHostMsgs` for `host` module to keep wildcard "*" string which allows all messages.
- (apps/27-interchain-accounts) [\#2297](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/2297) Adding cli command to generate ICS27 packet data.
- (modules/core/keeper) [\#1728](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/2399) Updated channel callback errors to include portID & channelID for better identification of errors.
- (testing) [\#2657](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/2657) Carry `ProposerAddress` through committed blocks. Allow `DefaultGenTxGas` to be modified.
- (core/03-connection) [\#2745](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/2745) Adding `ConnectionParams` grpc query and CLI to 03-connection.
- (apps/29-fee) [\#2786](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/2786) Save gas by checking key existence with `KVStore`'s `Has` method.

## Features

- (apps/27-interchain-accounts) [\#2147](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/2147) Adding a `SubmitTx` gRPC endpoint for the ICS27 Controller module which allows owners of interchain accounts to submit transactions. This replaces the previously existing need for authentication modules to implement this standard functionality.
- (testing/simapp) [\#2190](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/2190) Adding the new `x/group` cosmos-sdk module to simapp.
- (apps/transfer) [\#2595](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/2595) Adding optional memo field to `FungibleTokenPacketData` and `MsgTransfer`.

## Bug Fixes

- (modules/core/keeper) [\#2403](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/2403) Added a function in keeper to cater for blank pointers.
- (apps/transfer) [\#2679](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/2679) Check `x/bank` send enabled.
- (modules/core/keeper) [\#2745](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/2745) Fix request wiring for `UpgradedConsensusState` in core query server.
