</Note>

## Pre-requisite readings

* [Fee Middleware](/docs/ibc/v7.8.x/middleware/ics29-fee/overview.mdx)

## Summary

Different types of end users:

* CLI users who want to manually incentivize IBC packets
* Client developers

The Fee Middleware module allows end users to add a 'tip' to each IBC packet which will incentivize relayer operators to relay packets between chains. gRPC endpoints are exposed for client developers as well as a simple CLI for manually incentivizing IBC packets.

## CLI Users

For an in depth guide on how to use the ICS29 Fee Middleware module using the CLI please take a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/wiki/Fee-enabled-fungible-token-transfers#asynchronous-incentivization-of-a-fungible-token-transfer) on the `ibc-go` repo.

## Client developers

Client developers can read more about the relevant ICS29 message types in the [Fee messages section](/docs/ibc/v7.8.x/middleware/ics29-fee/msgs.mdx).

[CosmJS](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs) is a useful client library for signing and broadcasting Cosmos SDK messages.
