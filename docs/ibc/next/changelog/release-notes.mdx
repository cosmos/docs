{/*
Guiding Principles:
- Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
- There should be an entry for every single version.
- The same types of changes should be grouped.
- Versions and sections should be linkable.
- The latest version comes first.
- The release date of each version is displayed.
- Mention whether you follow Semantic Versioning.

Usage:
- Change log entries are to be added to the Unreleased section under the
  appropriate stanza (see below). Each entry should ideally include a tag and
  the Github issue reference in the following format:
- * (<tag>) \#<issue-number> message
- The issue numbers will later be link-ified during the release process so you do
  not have to worry about including a link manually, but you can if you wish.

Types of changes (Stanzas):
- "Features" for new features.
- "Improvements" for changes in existing functionality.
- "Deprecated" for soon-to-be removed features.
- "Bug Fixes" for any bug fixes.
- "Client Breaking" for breaking CLI commands and REST routes used by end-users.
- "API Breaking" for breaking exported APIs used by developers building on SDK.
- "State Machine Breaking" for any changes that result in a different AppState given the same genesisState and txList.
