## Overview

The IBC-Go protocol has undergone multiple comprehensive security audits by leading blockchain security firms. These audits cover various components and features of the IBC protocol, ensuring robust security across all major functionality areas. Each audit provides an independent assessment of code quality, potential vulnerabilities, and architectural design.

## Available Audit Reports

### IBC v2 Protocol Audit
