## State Machine Breaking

- (apps/transfer) [\#2651](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/2651) Introduce `mustProtoMarshalJSON` for ics20 packet data marshalling which will skip emission (marshalling) of the memo field if unpopulated (empty).

## API Breaking

- (testing)[\#2028](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/2028) New interface `ibctestingtypes.StakingKeeper` added and set for the testing app `StakingKeeper` setup.
- (core/04-channel) [\#1418](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/1418) `NewPacketId` has been renamed to `NewPacketID` to comply with go linting rules.
- (core/ante) [\#1418](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/1418) `AnteDecorator` has been renamed to `RedundancyDecorator` to comply with go linting rules and to give more clarity to the purpose of the Decorator.
