## Key Findings and Mitigations

All critical and high-severity findings identified in these audits have been addressed in v8.5.x. The audit reports include:

- Detailed vulnerability descriptions
- Risk assessments and impact analysis
- Recommended mitigations
- Implementation responses

## Best Practices for Developers

When working with IBC-Go v8.5.x:

1. **Review Feature Audits**: Consult relevant audit reports before implementing features
2. **Follow Security Guidelines**: Implement the security patterns recommended in audits
3. **Validate Inputs**: Always validate cross-chain messages and parameters
4. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Implement robust error handling for IBC operations
5. **Test Edge Cases**: Include security test cases based on audit findings

## Ongoing Security Efforts

The IBC-Go team continuously improves security through:

- Regular security audits for new features
- Bug bounty programs
- Security advisory system
- Collaboration with security researchers
- Rapid patching of vulnerabilities

## Reporting Security Issues
