Cosmos-EVM is the easiest way to build your own EVM compatible L1 blockchain using the Cosmos SDK. This guide walks through the process of creating and running a network by simply modifying the "template" blockchain application bubdled with the module repo.

## Why Cosmos-EVM?

In addition to being a standalone module, the [Cosmos/EVM](https://github.com/cosmos/evm) project repository includes `evmd`, a complete working blockchain pre-wired with the EVM module and a few supporting modules. Using this as a starting point for your project eliminates the complexity of assembling and integrating components from scratch, allowing engineers to focus on building on your chain rather than debugging basic setup issues.


## Understanding the Stack

Before diving into configuration, it's helpful to understand what you're building with:

- **[Cosmos SDK Modules](/docs/evm/v0.5.0/documentation/cosmos-sdk)** - Core blockchain functionality including staking, governance, and token management
- **[Precompiles](/docs/evm/v0.5.0/documentation/smart-contracts/precompiles)** - Smart contract interfaces that bridge EVM and Cosmos SDK capabilities
