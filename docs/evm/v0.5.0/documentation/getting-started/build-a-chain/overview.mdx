Cosmos-EVM is the easiest way to build your own EVM compatible L1 blockchain using the Cosmos SDK. This guide walks through the process of creating and running a network by simply modifying the "template" blockchain application bubdled with the module repo.

## Why Cosmos-EVM?

In addition to being a standalone module, the [Cosmos/EVM](https://github.com/cosmos/evm) project repository includes `evmd`, a complete working blockchain pre-wired with the EVM module and a few supporting modules.

Because this example is actively developed and maintained alongside the module itself and serves as the canonical reference implementation, it is the perfect starting point to modify and customize into your own EVM-compatible chain.
One of the largest benefits is the simplicity and time saved. Rather than researching and going through the trial and error process of assembling components individually and figuring out what works, simply fork `evmd` and customize it to your needs.
This approach lets engineers focus on what makes your chain unique rather than debugging basic integration issues.

## Understanding the Stack

Before diving into configuration, it's helpful to understand what you're building with:

- **[Cosmos SDK Modules](/docs/evm/v0.5.0/documentation/cosmos-sdk)** - Core blockchain functionality including staking, governance, and token management
- **[Precompiles](/docs/evm/v0.5.0/documentation/smart-contracts/precompiles)** - Smart contract interfaces that bridge EVM and Cosmos SDK capabilities
- **[Security & Audits](/docs/evm/v0.5.0/documentation/overview#audits)** - Third-party security assessments of the codebase
