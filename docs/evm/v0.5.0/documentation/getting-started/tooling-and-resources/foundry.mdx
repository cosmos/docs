Foundry is a fast and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust. It provides four main command-line tools—`forge`, `cast`, `anvil`, and `chisel`—to streamline everything from project setup to live-chain interactions.

Among these, `cast` serves as your "Swiss-army knife" for JSON-RPC calls, letting you execute tedious day-to-day tasks (like sending raw transactions, querying balances, fetching blocks, and looking up chain metadata) with simple, consistent commands instead of verbose `curl` scripts.

This guide walks you through installing Foundry, configuring your environment, and using the most common `cast` commands to accelerate your development workflow.

## Installation & Setup

### Install Foundry

Run the following command to install `foundryup`, the Foundry toolchain installer. This will give you the four main binaries.

```bash lines
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

After installation, you can switch to the nightly builds for the latest features, though this is optional.

```bash lines
foundryup -i nightly
```

### Verify Installation

Check that each binary was installed correctly by running:

```bash lines expandable
foundryup --version
cast --version
forge --version
anvil --version
```

You should see version outputs for each tool (e.g., `cast 0.2.0`).

## Configuration

To avoid passing the `--rpc-url` flag with every command, you can set defaults in a `foundry.toml` file. This file can be placed in your project's root directory for project-specific settings, or you can create a global configuration at `~/.foundry/foundry.toml` for settings you use across all projects.

Here is an example of a global configuration for connecting to a local Cosmos EVM node:

```toml title="~/.foundry/foundry.toml" lines expandable
# ~/.foundry/foundry.toml

# Declare your named endpoints (optional; for forge test / forking)
[rpc_endpoints]
cosmos = "<evm_rpc_url>"

# Configure the default profile for cast/forge/anvil
[profile.default]
# Tell Foundry which chain you're targeting:
chain_id     = 4321
# Directly tell cast to use your endpoint:
eth_rpc_url  = "<evm_rpc_url>"
# Set EVM version for Solidity compilation
evm_version  = "istanbul"
```

With this global configuration, Foundry tools will automatically connect to your local node without needing additional flags.

## Basic Usage of `cast`

`cast` replaces the need for custom shell scripts and verbose `curl` commands by offering first-class RPC commands.

### Chain Metadata

- **Get Chain ID**
  ```bash lines
  cast chain-id --rpc-url local
  ```
  Returns the chain ID in decimal format.

- **Get Client Version**
  ```bash lines
  cast client --rpc-url local
  ```
  Displays the client implementation and version (e.g., `reth/v1.0.0`).

## `cast` Command Reference

### Chain Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `cast chain` | Show the symbolic name of the current chain. |
| `cast chain-id` | Fetch the numeric chain ID. |
| `cast client` | Get the JSON-RPC client version. |

**Example**:
```bash lines
# Assuming FOUNDRY_RPC_URL is set or using a configured alias
cast chain
cast chain-id
cast client
```

### Transaction Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `cast send` | Sign and publish a transaction. |
| `cast publish` | Publish a raw, signed transaction. |
| `cast receipt` | Fetch the receipt for a transaction hash. |
| `cast tx` | Query transaction details (status, logs, etc.). |
| `cast rpc` | Invoke any raw JSON-RPC method. |

- **Sign and Send** (using a private key or local keystore):
  ```bash lines
  cast send 0xRecipientAddress "transfer(address,uint256)" "0xSomeOtherAddress,100" --private-key $YOUR_PK
  ```

- **Publish Raw Transaction** (hex-encoded):
  ```bash lines
  cast publish 0xf86b808504a817c80082520894...
  ```

- **Generic RPC Call**:
  ```bash lines
  cast rpc eth_sendRawTransaction 0xf86b8085...
  ```

### Account & Block Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `cast balance` | Get an account's balance (supports ENS and units). |
| `cast block` | Fetch block information by number or hash. |
| `cast block-number`| Get the latest block number. |
| `cast logs` | Query event logs. |

- **Get Balance** (with unit flag):
  ```bash lines
  # Using an ENS name on Ethereum mainnet
  cast balance vitalik.eth --ether --rpc-url https://eth.merkle.io
  ```

- **Get Block Details**:
  ```bash lines
  cast block latest
  ```

### Utility & Conversion Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `cast estimate` | Estimate gas for a call or deployment. |
| `cast find-block` | Find a block by its timestamp. |
| `cast compute-address`| Calculate a CREATE2 address. |
| `cast from-bin` | Decode binary data to hex. |
| `cast from-wei` | Convert wei to a more readable unit (e.g., ether). |
| `cast to-wei` | Convert a unit (e.g., ether) to wei. |
| `cast abi-encode` | Encode function arguments. |
| `cast keccak` | Hash data with Keccak-256. |

These commands allow you to drop one-off scripts for common conversions and estimations.

## Streamlining Repetative / Tedious tasks

When performing testing or development roles you may find yourself doing one or more small but very
tedious tasks frequently.
In your shell's configuration file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`), you can alias `cast` with your default RPC URL
(or multiple on various chains) to save time.

```bash lines expandable
# Set your default RPC endpoint
export CDEV_RPC="<evm_rpc_url>"
# Create an alias
alias ccast='cast --rpc-url $CDEV_RPC'

# Now you can run commands like:
ccast balance 0x...
```

This is an extremely basic example of how you can improve your workflows by building upon the heavy lifting Foundry already does out of the box.
