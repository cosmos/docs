## EVM Wallet Compatibility[​](#evm-wallet-compatibility "Direct link to EVM Wallet Compatibility")

**Any standard EVM wallet works out of the box with Cosmos EVM chains.** This includes popular wallets like MetaMask, Rabby, WalletConnect, and any other wallet that supports Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains. No special configuration or custom integration is required - simply add your chain's RPC endpoint and chain ID to any EVM wallet.

### Key Integration Points[​](#key-integration-points "Direct link to Key Integration Points")

* **Standard EVM RPC**: Cosmos EVM exposes the standard Ethereum JSON-RPC API, ensuring compatibility with all EVM wallets
* **EIP-1559 Support**: Full support for EIP-1559 dynamic fee transactions, enabling automatic gas estimation
* **Address Format**: Uses standard Ethereum addresses (0x format) for EVM transactions
* **Transaction Types**: Supports all standard Ethereum transaction types including legacy and EIP-1559 transactions

## Client Libraries[​](#client-libraries "Direct link to Client Libraries")

For programmatic wallet integration, use standard Ethereum client libraries like ethers.js, web3.js, or viem which are fully compatible with Cosmos EVM chains.

## Quick Start[​](#quick-start "Direct link to Quick Start")

To add a Cosmos EVM chain to MetaMask or any EVM wallet:

1. Open your wallet and navigate to "Add Network"

2. Enter the following details:

   * **Network Name**: Your chain name
   * **RPC URL**: Your chain's JSON-RPC endpoint (port 8545)
   * **Chain ID**: Your EVM chain ID (integer)
   * **Currency Symbol**: Your native token symbol
   * **Block Explorer URL**: (optional) Your chain's block explorer

That's it! Your wallet is now ready to interact with the Cosmos EVM chain.
