## Cosmos Coins[​](#cosmos-coins "Direct link to Cosmos Coins")

Accounts can own Cosmos coins in their balance, which are used for operations with other Cosmos and transactions. Examples of these are using the coins for staking, IBC transfers, governance deposits and EVM.

## EVM Tokens[​](#evm-tokens "Direct link to EVM Tokens")

Cosmos EVM is compatible with ERC20 tokens and other non-fungible token standards (EIP721, EIP1155) that are natively supported by the EVM.
