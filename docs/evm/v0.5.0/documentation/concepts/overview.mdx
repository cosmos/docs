The Cosmos EVM module implements a complete Ethereum Virtual Machine as a Cosmos SDK module, providing an Ethereum-compatible interface to the underlying Cosmos consensus and infrastructure while enabling access to the broader Cosmos ecosystem.

## Platform Integration

The EVM module sits atop the Cosmos SDK platform, leveraging its modular architecture:

- **Consensus Layer**: CometBFT provides Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus with instant finality
- **State Management**: Cosmos SDK's IAVL tree and KVStore handle state persistence
- **Account System**: Unified account model supporting both Ethereum and Cosmos address formats
- **Module Ecosystem**: Direct access to staking, governance, bank, and IBC modules through precompiles

## Ethereum Compatibility

The EVM module provides complete Ethereum compatibility, enabling all standard Ethereum tooling and workflows:

- **Smart Contracts**: Full EVM bytecode execution with identical gas costs and opcode behavior
- **Transaction Types**: Support for all Ethereum transaction formats including EIP-1559 and EIP-7702
- **JSON-RPC API**: Complete Ethereum RPC implementation for seamless tool integration
- **Development Tools**: Works with MetaMask, Hardhat, Foundry, Remix, and all Ethereum development frameworks

## Enhanced Features

### Cosmos SDK Benefits
- **Instant Finality**: Transactions are final after one block (~2 seconds) with no reorganizations
- **Cross-Chain Integration**: Native IBC support for interacting with other Cosmos chains
- **Modular Access**: Smart contracts can directly interact with staking, governance, and other Cosmos modules
- **Enhanced Security**: Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus with stake-based validator selection

## Key Differences from Standard Ethereum

- **Consensus**: CometBFT instead of proof-of-stake, providing instant finality
- **State Storage**: IAVL tree and Cosmos SDK KVStore instead of Merkle Patricia Tree  
- **Fee Distribution**: Base fees distributed to validators instead of burned
- **Cross-Chain**: Native IBC integration for seamless interchain operations
- **Module Access**: Smart contracts can directly call Cosmos SDK modules

## Developer Experience

Developers can build on Cosmos EVM using familiar Ethereum tools and patterns:

- **Standard Tooling**: MetaMask, Hardhat, Foundry, Remix work without modification
- **Ethereum Libraries**: Web3.js, Ethers.js, and other libraries work seamlessly
- **Smart Contracts**: Deploy existing Ethereum contracts without changes
- **Enhanced Capabilities**: Access Cosmos modules and IBC through precompiled contracts
