# Smart Contract Development on Cosmos EVM

Since the introduction of Ethereum in 2015, the ability to control digital assets through smart contracts has attracted a large community of developers to build decentralized applications on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Cosmos EVM brings this powerful ecosystem to Cosmos chains with full compatibility.

> **Cosmos EVM is fully compatible with the EVM**, allowing you to use the same tools (Solidity, Remix, Oracles) and APIs (Ethereum JSON-RPC) that are available on Ethereum.

## Why Build on Cosmos EVM?

Whether you're building new use cases on a Cosmos EVM-enabled chain or porting an existing dApp from Ethereum, you can:

* **Use familiar tools** - Deploy with the same Solidity contracts and development environment
* **Access Cosmos features** - Leverage cross-chain interoperability through IBC
* **Scale your applications** - Build on performant, application-specific blockchains
* **Extend functionality** - Use custom precompiles for staking, governance, and more

## Getting Started

### Build with Solidity

Develop EVM smart contracts using [Solidity](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity), the most widely used smart contract language. If you've deployed on Ethereum or any EVM-compatible chain, you can use the same contracts on Cosmos EVM.

* **Write Your First Contract:** Follow the [Solidity Beginner Tutorial](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html)
* **Set Up Your Tools:** Use [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/) or [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) for your development environment
* **Test and Deploy:** Learn testing patterns with [OpenZeppelin's Guides](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/learn)
* **Ensure Security:** Follow [OpenZeppelin's Security Patterns](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/learn/security-patterns)

### Deploy with Ethereum JSON-RPC

Cosmos EVM supports the full [Ethereum JSON-RPC](/docs/evm/v0.5.0/api-reference/ethereum-json-rpc) API, enabling you to:

* Deploy and interact with smart contracts using familiar web3 tools
* Connect existing Ethereum tooling without modifications
* Use [block explorers](/docs/evm/v0.5.0/documentation/getting-started/tooling-and-resources/block-explorers) to debug and monitor your contracts

### Leverage Cosmos EVM Precompiles

Unlike standard EVM, Cosmos EVM introduces **stateful precompiled contracts** that can perform state transitions. These custom precompiles enable:

* **Native staking operations** - Stake tokens directly from smart contracts
* **On-chain governance** - Participate in governance through contract calls
* **Cross-chain communication** - Access IBC functionality programmatically
* **Advanced cryptography** - Use elliptic curve operations efficiently

These precompiles open up functionality that would be impossible or prohibitively expensive with regular smart contracts. [View all available precompiles â†’](/docs/evm/v0.5.0/documentation/smart-contracts/precompiles)

## Development Workflow

1. **Choose your tooling** - Select from Hardhat, Foundry, or other familiar EVM development frameworks
2. **Write smart contracts** - Develop in Solidity with access to Cosmos-specific precompiles
3. **Test thoroughly** - Use existing testing frameworks with Cosmos EVM's full compatibility
4. **Deploy seamlessly** - Use Ethereum JSON-RPC to deploy just like on any EVM chain
5. **Monitor and iterate** - Use block explorers and debugging tools to refine your dApp
