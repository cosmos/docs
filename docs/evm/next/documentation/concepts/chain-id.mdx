## Dual Chain ID System

Cosmos EVM requires **two completely independent chain IDs** to maintain full compatibility with both the Cosmos SDK and Ethereum ecosystems.

### 1. Cosmos Chain ID (String)

The **Cosmos Chain ID** is a string identifier used by:
- CometBFT consensus engine
- IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) protocol
- Native Cosmos SDK transactions
- Chain upgrades and governance

**Format**: Any string (recommended format: `"mychain-1"`, `"testnet-2"`)

**Example**:
```json
// In genesis.json
{
  "chain_id": "mychain-1"
}
```

### 2. EVM Chain ID (Integer)

The **EVM Chain ID** is an integer used by:
- Ethereum transactions (EIP-155 replay protection)
- MetaMask and other Ethereum wallets
- Smart contract deployments
- EVM tooling (Hardhat, Foundry, etc.)

**Format**: Any unique positive integer (check [chainlist.org](https://chainlist.org))

**Example**:
```toml
# In app.toml
[evm]
chain-id = 262144
```

## Configuration

Both chain IDs must be configured when setting up your chain:

### In Your Application Code

```go "Chain ID Configuration" expandable
// app/app.go
const (
    CosmosChainID = "cosmosevm-1"  // String for Cosmos/IBC
    EVMChainID    = 9000           // Integer for EVM/Ethereum
)
```

### In Genesis Configuration

The Cosmos Chain ID is set in `genesis.json`:
```json "Genesis Chain ID Configuration" expandable
{
  "chain_id": "cosmosevm-1",
  // ... other genesis parameters
}
```

The EVM Chain ID is configured in the EVM module parameters:
```go "EVM Chain ID Initialization" expandable
// During chain initialization
evmtypes.DefaultChainConfig(9000)  // Your EVM Chain ID
```

## Important Considerations

### EVM Chain ID Guidelines

When selecting your EVM Chain ID:
1. **Check availability**: Verify your chosen ID is not already in use on [chainlist.org](https://chainlist.org/)
2. **Avoid conflicts**: Don't use well-known chain IDs (1 for Ethereum mainnet, 137 for Polygon, etc.)
3. **Choose any available integer**: There are no required ranges or formats - simply pick any integer not in use

### Chain Upgrades

<Note>
Unlike traditional Cosmos chains that change their chain ID during upgrades (e.g., `cosmoshub-4` to `cosmoshub-5`), the EVM Chain ID must remain **constant** across upgrades to maintain compatibility with deployed smart contracts and existing wallets.
</Note>

Only the Cosmos Chain ID may change during chain upgrades if needed for consensus-breaking changes. The EVM Chain ID should never change once set.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Chain ID mismatch" errors**
   - **Cause**: Using Cosmos Chain ID where EVM Chain ID is expected (or vice versa)
   - **Solution**: Ensure you're using the correct type of chain ID for each context

2. **MetaMask connection failures**
   - **Cause**: Incorrect EVM Chain ID in wallet configuration
   - **Solution**: Use the integer EVM Chain ID, not the string Cosmos Chain ID

3. **IBC transfer failures**
   - **Cause**: Using EVM Chain ID for IBC operations
   - **Solution**: IBC always uses the Cosmos Chain ID (string format)

4. **Smart contract deployment issues**
   - **Cause**: EIP-155 replay protection using wrong chain ID
   - **Solution**: Ensure your EVM Chain ID matches what's configured in the chain

### Verification Commands

To verify your chain IDs are correctly configured:

```bash "Chain ID Verification Commands" expandable
# Check Cosmos Chain ID
curl -s http://localhost:26657/status | jq '.result.node_info.network'

# Check EVM Chain ID
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_chainId","params":[],"id":1}' \
  http://localhost:8545 | jq '.result'
```
