## Dual Chain ID System

Cosmos EVM requires **two separate chain IDs** to maintain full compatibility with both the Cosmos SDK and Ethereum ecosystems:

### 1. Cosmos Chain ID (String)

The **Cosmos Chain ID** is a string identifier used by:
- CometBFT consensus engine
- IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) protocol
- Native Cosmos SDK transactions
- Chain upgrades and governance

**Format**: String with flexible naming (e.g., `"cosmosevm-1"`, `"mychain-testnet-2"`)

**Example**:
```json
// In genesis.json
{
  "chain_id": "cosmosevm-1"
}
```

### 2. EVM Chain ID (Integer)

The **EVM Chain ID** is an integer used by:
- Ethereum transactions (EIP-155 replay protection)
- MetaMask and other Ethereum wallets
- Smart contract deployments
- EVM tooling (Hardhat, Foundry, etc.)

**Format**: Positive integer (e.g., `9000`, `9001`)

**Example**:
```go
// In app/app.go
const EVMChainID = 9000
```

## Configuration

Both chain IDs must be configured when setting up your chain:

### In Your Application Code

```go "Chain ID Configuration" expandable
// app/app.go
const (
    CosmosChainID = "cosmosevm-1"  // String for Cosmos/IBC
    EVMChainID    = 9000           // Integer for EVM/Ethereum
)
```

### In Genesis Configuration

The Cosmos Chain ID is set in `genesis.json`:
```json "Genesis Chain ID Configuration" expandable
{
  "chain_id": "cosmosevm-1",
  // ... other genesis parameters
}
```

The EVM Chain ID is configured in the EVM module parameters:
```go "EVM Chain ID Initialization" expandable
// During chain initialization
evmtypes.DefaultChainConfig(9000)  // Your EVM Chain ID
```

## Important Considerations

### Chain ID Selection

<Warning>
The two chain IDs serve different purposes and **must not be confused**:
- Use the **Cosmos Chain ID** (string) for IBC connections, governance proposals, and Cosmos SDK operations
- Use the **EVM Chain ID** (integer) for MetaMask configuration, smart contract deployments, and EIP-155 transaction signing
</Warning>

### EVM Chain ID Guidelines

When selecting your EVM Chain ID:
1. **Check availability**: Verify your chosen ID is not already in use on [chainlist.org](https://chainlist.org/)
2. **Avoid conflicts**: Don't use well-known chain IDs (1 for Ethereum mainnet, 137 for Polygon, etc.)
3. **Consider ranges**:
   - Production networks often use lower numbers
   - Testnets commonly use higher ranges (9000+)
   - Local development can use very high numbers (31337+)

### Chain Upgrades

<Note>
Unlike traditional Cosmos chains that change their chain ID during upgrades (e.g., `cosmoshub-4` to `cosmoshub-5`), the EVM Chain ID must remain **constant** across upgrades to maintain compatibility with deployed smart contracts and existing wallets.
</Note>

Only the Cosmos Chain ID may change during chain upgrades if needed for consensus-breaking changes. The EVM Chain ID should never change once set.

## Examples

Here are some example configurations:

| Network Type | Cosmos Chain ID | EVM Chain ID | Notes |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|-------|
| Mainnet | `"cosmosevm-1"` | `9000` | Production network |
| Testnet | `"cosmosevm-testnet-1"` | `9001` | Public testnet |
| Devnet | `"cosmosevm-dev-1"` | `9002` | Development network |
| Local | `"cosmosevm-local-1"` | `31337` | Local development |
