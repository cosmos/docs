<Note>
**About the examples in this documentation**

Code and CLI examples use `evmd`, the reference implementation from [cosmos/evm](https://github.com/cosmos/evm). Examples can be run directly without modification using the native token denominations `test` (display) and `atest` (base, 18 decimals). To get started quickly, see [Local Node Setup](/docs/evm/next/documentation/getting-started/local-node-setup).
