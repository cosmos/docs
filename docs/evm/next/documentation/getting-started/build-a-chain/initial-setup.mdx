This page provides a basic starting point for anyone unfamiliar with the Cosmos SDK. You can skip to the [Pre-Genesis & Genesis Setup](/docs/evm/next/documentation/getting-started/build-a-chain/pre-genesis-and-genesis-setup) page if you are already comfortable with the stack.

## Prerequisites

### Required Dependencies

- **Go 1.23.8+** - Required for building the blockchain binary
- **Git** - For version control and repository management
- **Make** - For using build commands
- **GCC/Build Tools** - Required for CGo compilation
- **curl/wget** - For downloading dependencies (usually pre-installed)

### Installation by Platform

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)">

#### Using APT Package Manager

Update package lists and install build essentials:

```bash
# Update package lists
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install build essentials and dependencies
sudo apt install -y build-essential git make gcc curl wget
```

Install Go 1.22:

```bash expandable
# Download Go 1.22
wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.22.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz

# Remove old Go installation (if exists)
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go

# Extract and install
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.22.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz

# Clean up
rm go1.22.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz

# Add Go to PATH (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile)
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export GOPATH=$HOME/go' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# Create Go workspace directories
mkdir -p $HOME/go/{bin,src,pkg}
```

Verify installations:

```bash
go version      # Should show 1.22 or higher
git --version
make --version
gcc --version
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="macOS (ARM64/Apple Silicon)">

#### Using Homebrew (Recommended)

Install Homebrew if you haven't already:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

<Note>
After installing Homebrew on Apple Silicon, you may need to add it to your PATH:
```bash
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```
</Note>

Install the required dependencies:

```bash expandable
# Install build essentials
brew install git make gcc

# Install Go
brew install go@1.22

# Add Go to your PATH (add to ~/.zshrc)
echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/go@1.22/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# Set up Go environment
mkdir -p $HOME/go/{bin,src,pkg}
echo 'export GOPATH=$HOME/go' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

Verify installations:

```bash
go version      # Should show 1.22 or higher
git --version
make --version
gcc --version
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="macOS (Intel)">

#### Using Homebrew (Recommended)

Install Homebrew if you haven't already:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
# Install build essentials
brew install git make gcc

# Install Go
brew install go@1.22

# Add Go to your PATH (add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile)
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/go@1.22/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

Verify installations:

```bash
go version      # Should show 1.22 or higher
git --version
make --version
gcc --version
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Linux (Arch-based)">

#### Using Pacman Package Manager

Update system and install dependencies:

```bash
# Update system
sudo pacman -Syu

# Install build essentials and dependencies
sudo pacman -S base-devel git go make gcc curl wget
```

<Note>
Arch Linux's `go` package is typically very up-to-date. Verify the version meets requirements:
```bash
go version  # Should be 1.22 or higher
```
If the version is lower, you may need to install from source or use a version manager.
</Note>

Set up Go environment:

```bash
# Add Go environment variables (add to ~/.bashrc)
echo 'export GOPATH=$HOME/go' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# Create Go workspace directories
mkdir -p $HOME/go/{bin,src,pkg}
```

Verify installations:

```bash expandable
go version      # Should show 1.22 or higher
git --version
make --version
gcc --version
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Additional Setup

After installing the base dependencies, configure Git with your identity:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

## Fork and Clone the Repository

Start by creating your own copy of the evmd repository:

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub by visiting [github.com/cosmos/evm](https://github.com/cosmos/evm) and clicking the "Fork" button

2. **Clone your forked repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/evm.git
   cd evm
   ```

3. **Add upstream remote** to stay synchronized with updates:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/cosmos/evm.git
   ```

<Note>
Keeping your fork synchronized with upstream allows you to receive bug fixes, security patches, and new features from the core development team.
</Note>

## Understanding the Project Structure

The evmd repository is organized into several key directories:

```
evm/
├── app/              # Application configuration and module integration
├── cmd/evmd/         # Binary entrypoint and CLI commands
├── precompiles/      # EVM precompile implementations
├── x/                # Custom Cosmos SDK modules
│   ├── erc20/       # ERC20 token module
│   ├── evm/         # Core EVM module
│   └── feemarket/   # EIP-1559 fee market
├── scripts/          # Utility scripts including local_node.sh
└── tests/            # Test suites
```

## Build and Test

Verify your environment is properly set up by building the binary:

```bash
make install
```

This compiles the `evmd` binary and installs it to your `$GOPATH/bin` directory. Verify the installation:

```bash
evmd version
```

<Tip>
Before making any changes, it's recommended to run the test suite to ensure everything works correctly:

```bash
make test
```
</Tip>

### Precompiles
Learn about [precompiled contracts](/docs/evm/next/documentation/smart-contracts/precompiles) that bridge EVM smart contracts with Cosmos SDK functionality. These enable Solidity contracts to interact with native modules for staking, IBC transfers, and more.

## Quick Testing with local_node.sh

The repository includes a development script that launches a fully configured local testnet. This is useful for:
- Understanding the complete initialization sequence
- Testing your changes quickly
- Learning how different parameters affect the chain

Run the script:

```bash
./local_node.sh
```

This starts a validator node which runs a local chain accessible at `http://localhost:8545` with all namespaces enabled including "unsafe" ones such as `personal` which allows signing over the JSON-RPC with one of the pre-funded test wallets.
- Connect to with MetaMask or other Ethereum wallets (default chain ID: `262144`).
- Use the web tool to see a complete list of [EVM RPC](/docs/evm/next/api-reference/ethereum-json-rpc/rpc-explorer) endpoints and interact with the network.
- Explore the [light client](/docs/evm/next/documentation/cosmos-sdk/cli.mdx) interface to access the consensus layer, debugging and development features.


### [Optional] Cosmos SDK Modules
Explore the [Cosmos SDK modules](/docs/evm/next/documentation/cosmos-sdk) that provide core blockchain functionality:
- **[Bank](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/modules/bank)** - Token transfers and balances
- **[Staking](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/modules/staking)** - Validator delegation and rewards
- **[Governance](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/modules/governance)** - On-chain voting and proposals
- **[Slashing](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/modules/slashing)** - Validator penalty enforcement
- **[Distribution](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/modules/distribution)** - Fee and reward distribution

## Next Steps

With your development environment ready, you can start configuring the pre-launch parameters. To make the process more manageable, we will go through it in three sections:

1. **Pre-Genesis Configuration** - Set chain-id, token parameters and other values that are hard-coded.
2. **Genesis Configuration** - Initialize the chain and configure genesis.json parameters such as module configs, genesis token allocations, and validator set.
3. **Runtime Configuration** - Set up node-level settings and launch the network.

Proceed to the [Pre-Genesis & Genesis Setup](/docs/evm/next/documentation/getting-started/build-a-chain/pre-genesis-and-genesis-setup) guide to begin customizing your chain's identity and parameters.
