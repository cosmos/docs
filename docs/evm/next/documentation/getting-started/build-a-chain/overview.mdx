Building a production-ready blockchain with Cosmos EVM involves configuring parameters across three main phases: pre-genesis setup, genesis configuration, and runtime deployment. This guide provides a structured approach to each phase.

## Where To Start

The Cosmos EVM repository includes `evmd`, a fully functional blockchain that integrates the Cosmos SDK with the EVM module. Because `evmd` is developed and maintained alongside the module itself, it serves as the canonical reference implementation with production-ready defaults and best practices.

Starting with `evmd` provides several advantages:
- **Greater compatibility** - Direct alignment with the module's development ensures the configurations as described here work as intended
- **Improved troubleshooting** - Greater similarity to the base project makes it simpler to diagnose issues and find solutions, if they arise
- **Proven logic** - Real working examples of integration approaches used by the core development team are readily available on Github

Rather than assembling components from scratch, fork `evmd` and customize it for your specific needs. This approach lets you focus on what makes your chain unique rather than debugging basic integration issues.

Configure your chain's identity and core parameters. This includes both source code customization and genesis file preparation.

<Accordion title="Pre-Genesis Parameters">

## Local Development Testing

The `cosmos/evm` repository includes `local_node.sh`, a development script that streamlines testing by launching a private local testnet with practical defaults:

```bash
./local_node.sh -y  # Fresh start with clean state
```

This script demonstrates the complete initialization sequence and provides a working chain at `http://localhost:8545` that you can connect to with MetaMask or other Ethereum wallets using chain ID `262144`.

For a detailed explanation of what this script does and how to customize it, see the [Configuration Reference](/docs/evm/next/documentation/getting-started/build-a-chain/configuration-reference#understanding-local_nodesh).
