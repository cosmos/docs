Cosmos-EVM is the easiest way to build your own EVM compatible L1 blockchain using the Cosmos SDK. This guide walks through the process of creating and running a network by simply modifying the "template" blockchain application bubdled with the module repo.

## Why Cosmos-EVM?

In addition to being a standalone module, the [Cosmos/EVM](https://github.com/cosmos/evm) project repository includes `evmd`, a complete working blockchain pre-wired with the EVM module and a few supporting modules.

Because this example is actively developed and maintained alongside the module itself and serves as the canonical reference implementation, it is the perfect starting point to modify and customize into your own EVM-compatible chain.
One of the largest benefits is the simplicity and time saved. Rather than researching and going through the trial and error process of assembling components individually and figuring out what works, simply fork `evmd` and customize it to your needs.
This approach lets engineers focus on what makes your chain unique rather than debugging basic integration issues.

## Configuration Guides

The following three guides cover three general categories: Basic/Introductory setup, understanding and setting all network parameters, and final steps to launch the network successfully:

<div style={{maxWidth: '600px'}}>
<Card title="Initial Setup" href="/docs/evm/next/documentation/getting-started/build-a-chain/initial-setup">
Fork the repository and prepare your development environment
</Card>
</div>

<div style={{maxWidth: '600px'}}>
<Card title="Pre-Genesis & Genesis Setup" href="/docs/evm/next/documentation/getting-started/build-a-chain/pre-genesis-and-genesis-setup">
Configure chain identity, parameters, and genesis file
</Card>
</div>

<div style={{maxWidth: '600px'}}>
<Card title="Runtime Configuration & Launch" href="/docs/evm/next/documentation/getting-started/build-a-chain/runtime-and-launch">
Set up node configuration and coordinate network launch
</Card>
</div>

These guides are designed to be followed in order, taking you from an empty repository to a running blockchain network. For a comprehensive reference of all commands and configuration options, see the [Configuration Reference](/docs/evm/next/documentation/getting-started/build-a-chain/configuration-reference).

## Understanding the Stack

Before diving into configuration, it's helpful to understand what you're building with:

- **[Cosmos SDK Modules](/docs/evm/next/documentation/cosmos-sdk)** - Core blockchain functionality including staking, governance, and token management
- **[Precompiles](/docs/evm/next/documentation/smart-contracts/precompiles)** - Smart contract interfaces that bridge EVM and Cosmos SDK capabilities
- **[Security & Audits](/docs/evm/next/documentation/overview#audits)** - Third-party security assessments of the codebase

The [Configuration Reference](/docs/evm/next/documentation/getting-started/build-a-chain/configuration-reference) provides detailed examples and command references that complement the main guides, useful when you need to look up specific syntax or troubleshoot particular settings.



## Advanced Configuration

For specialized customization beyond the core configuration:

<div style={{maxWidth: '600px'}}>
<Card title="EVM Mempool Integration" href="/docs/evm/next/documentation/getting-started/build-a-chain/additional-configuration/mempool-integration">
Configure the EVM mempool for nonce gap handling and transaction prioritization
</Card>
</div>

<div style={{maxWidth: '600px'}}>
<Card title="Predeployed Contracts" href="/docs/evm/next/documentation/getting-started/build-a-chain/additional-configuration/predeployed-contracts">
Deploy standard contracts at genesis for Create2, Multicall3, Permit2, and Safe
</Card>
</div>



## Local Development Testing

The `cosmos/evm` repository includes `local_node.sh`, a development script that streamlines testing by launching a private local testnet with practical defaults:

```bash expandable
./local_node.sh -y  # Fresh start with clean state
```

This script demonstrates the complete initialization sequence and provides a working chain at `http://localhost:8545` that you can connect to with MetaMask or other Ethereum wallets using chain ID `262144`.

For a detailed explanation of what this script does and how to customize it, see the [Configuration Reference](/docs/evm/next/documentation/getting-started/build-a-chain/configuration-reference#understanding-local_nodesh).
