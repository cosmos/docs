Building a production-ready blockchain with Cosmos EVM involves configuring parameters across three main phases: pre-genesis setup, genesis configuration, and runtime deployment. This guide provides a structured approach to launching your own EVM-compatible Layer 1 chain.

## Why Cosmos-EVM?

The Cosmos EVM repository includes `evmd`, a fully functional blockchain that integrates the Cosmos SDK with the EVM module. Because `evmd` is developed and maintained alongside the module itself, it serves as the canonical reference implementation with production-ready defaults and best practices.

Starting with `evmd` provides several advantages:
- **Greater compatibility** - Direct alignment with the module's development ensures the configurations work as intended
- **Improved troubleshooting** - Greater similarity to the base project makes it simpler to diagnose issues and find solutions
- **Proven logic** - Integration approaches used by the core development team are readily available and battle-tested
- **Peace of mind** - Fully audited (as of v0.4.x) with comprehensive [security audits](/docs/evm/next/documentation/overview#audits)
- **Developer Community** - Cosmos EVM already powers multiple projects, with many more planning to migrate. There's no shortage of experience and knowledge to draw from and contribute to!

Rather than assembling components from scratch, fork `evmd` and customize it for your specific needs. This approach lets you focus on what makes your chain unique rather than debugging basic integration issues.

## Configuration Guides

The following three guides will walk you through building and launching your own EVM L1 chain:

<div style={{maxWidth: '600px'}}>
<Card title="Initial Setup" href="/docs/evm/next/documentation/getting-started/build-a-chain/initial-setup">
Fork the repository and prepare your development environment
</Card>
</div>

<div style={{maxWidth: '600px'}}>
<Card title="Pre-Genesis & Genesis Setup" href="/docs/evm/next/documentation/getting-started/build-a-chain/pre-genesis-and-genesis-setup">
Configure chain identity, parameters, and genesis file
</Card>
</div>

<div style={{maxWidth: '600px'}}>
<Card title="Runtime Configuration & Launch" href="/docs/evm/next/documentation/getting-started/build-a-chain/runtime-and-launch">
Set up node configuration and coordinate network launch
</Card>
</div>

These guides are designed to be followed in order, taking you from an empty repository to a running blockchain network. For a comprehensive reference of all commands and configuration options, see the [Configuration Reference](/docs/evm/next/documentation/getting-started/build-a-chain/configuration-reference).

## Understanding the Stack

Before diving into configuration, it's helpful to understand what you're building with:

- **[Cosmos SDK Modules](/docs/evm/next/documentation/cosmos-sdk)** - Core blockchain functionality including staking, governance, and token management
- **[Precompiles](/docs/evm/next/documentation/smart-contracts/precompiles)** - Smart contract interfaces that bridge EVM and Cosmos SDK capabilities
- **[Security & Audits](/docs/evm/next/documentation/overview#audits)** - Third-party security assessments of the codebase

The [Configuration Reference](/docs/evm/next/documentation/getting-started/build-a-chain/configuration-reference) provides detailed examples and command references that complement the main guides, useful when you need to look up specific syntax or troubleshoot particular settings.



## Advanced Configuration

For specialized customization beyond the core configuration:

<div style={{maxWidth: '600px'}}>
<Card title="EVM Mempool Integration" href="/docs/evm/next/documentation/getting-started/build-a-chain/additional-configuration/mempool-integration">
Configure the EVM mempool for nonce gap handling and transaction prioritization
</Card>
</div>

<div style={{maxWidth: '600px'}}>
<Card title="Predeployed Contracts" href="/docs/evm/next/documentation/getting-started/build-a-chain/additional-configuration/predeployed-contracts">
Deploy standard contracts at genesis for Create2, Multicall3, Permit2, and Safe
</Card>
</div>



## Local Development Testing

The `cosmos/evm` repository includes `local_node.sh`, a development script that streamlines testing by launching a private local testnet with practical defaults:

```bash expandable
./local_node.sh -y  # Fresh start with clean state
```

This script demonstrates the complete initialization sequence and provides a working chain at `http://localhost:8545` that you can connect to with MetaMask or other Ethereum wallets using chain ID `262144`.

For a detailed explanation of what this script does and how to customize it, see the [Configuration Reference](/docs/evm/next/documentation/getting-started/build-a-chain/configuration-reference#understanding-local_nodesh).
