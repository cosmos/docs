## "Pre-deployed" Contracts

### Default Preinstalls

These contracts are included in `evmtypes.DefaultPreinstalls` and can be deployed at genesis or via governance:

| Contract | Address | Purpose | Documentation |
|----------|---------|---------|---------------|
| **Create2** | `0x4e59b44847b379578588920ca78fbf26c0b4956c` | Deterministic contract deployment using CREATE2 opcode | [Details](/docs/evm/v0.4.x/documentation/smart-contracts/predeployed-contracts/create2.mdx) |
| **Multicall3** | `0xcA11bde05977b3631167028862bE2a173976CA11` | Batch multiple contract calls in a single transaction | [Details](/docs/evm/v0.4.x/documentation/smart-contracts/predeployed-contracts/multicall3.mdx) |
| **Permit2** | `0x000000000022D473030F116dDEE9F6B43aC78BA3` | Token approval and transfer management with signatures | [Details](/docs/evm/v0.4.x/documentation/smart-contracts/predeployed-contracts/permit2.mdx) |
| **Safe Singleton Factory** | `0x914d7Fec6aaC8cd542e72Bca78B30650d45643d7` | Deploy Safe multisig wallets at deterministic addresses | [Details](/docs/evm/v0.4.x/documentation/smart-contracts/predeployed-contracts/safe-factory.mdx) |

Additional pre-deployable contracts can be incorporated into your project in a similar way, given that any dependencies are met.
