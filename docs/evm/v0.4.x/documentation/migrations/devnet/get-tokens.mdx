## Faucet

To receive funds on the Cosmos EVM Devnet you can use [our faucet](https://faucet.cosmos.network).

<Info>Wallets will be topped up only to a maximum amount of each token at any given time.</Info>

- Requests can be made using either a Cosmos or EVM style address.
- EVM wallet requests will be given a small package of 4 different tokens, as well as native ATOM.
  - WATOM (wrapped native token in ERC20 format - functionally identical to WETH on Ethereum mainnet. Also thanks to a feature unique to Cosmos-EVM, it can be handled as both the "Native token" and the standard wrapped ERC20 format simultaneously with no additional input)
  - WBTC (natural ERC20, 18 decimal)
  - PEPE (natural ERC20, 18 decimal)
  - USDT (natural ERC20, 6 decimal)

<Warning>**These are test tokens ONLY** and hold zero value, intrinsic or implied.</Warning>
