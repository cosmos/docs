Specification of the consensus protocol implemented in CometBFT.

## Contents

- [Consensus Paper](/cometbft/v0.37/spec/consensus/consensus-paper) - Latex paper on
  [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04938) describing the
  Tendermint consensus algorithm, adopted in CometBFT, with proofs of safety and termination.
- [BFT Time](/cometbft/v0.37/spec/consensus/bft-time) - How the timestamp in a CometBFT
  block header is computed in a Byzantine Fault Tolerant manner
- [Creating Proposal](/cometbft/v0.37/spec/consensus/creating-proposal) - How a proposer
  creates a block proposal for consensus
- [Light Client Protocol](/cometbft/v0.37/spec/consensus/light-client) - A protocol for light weight consensus
  verification and syncing to the latest state
- [Signing](/cometbft/v0.37/spec/consensus/signing) - Rules for cryptographic signatures
  produced by validators.
- [Write Ahead Log](/cometbft/v0.37/spec/consensus/wal) - Write ahead log used by the
  consensus state machine to recover from crashes.

There is also a [stale markdown description](/cometbft/v0.37/spec/consensus/consensus) of the consensus state machine
(TODO update this).
