# IBC Documentation

The Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) is a protocol for authentication and transport of data between blockchains.

## Overview

IBC enables secure and reliable communication between independent blockchains, allowing them to transfer tokens and other data in a trust-minimized way.

### Key Features

- **Interoperability** - Connect heterogeneous blockchains
- **Security** - Cryptographic verification of cross-chain messages
- **Composability** - Build cross-chain applications
- **Modularity** - Extensible protocol design
