Rate limits are set through a governance-gated authority {/* cosmos/ibc-go modules/apps/rate-limiting/keeper/msg_server.go:33 — signer must equal k.authority (the governance module address) */} on a per denom, and per channel / client basis. {/* cosmos/ibc-go modules/apps/rate-limiting/types/msgs.go:29 — Denom and ChannelOrClientId are both required fields on MsgAddRateLimit */} To add a rate limit, the [`MsgAddRateLimit`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/main/modules/apps/rate-limiting/types/msgs.go#L27-L35) message must be executed which includes:

* Denom: the asset that the rate limit should be applied to {/* cosmos/ibc-go modules/apps/rate-limiting/types/msgs.go:29 */}
* ChannelOrClientId: the channelID for use with IBC classic connections, or the clientID for use with IBC v2 connections {/* cosmos/ibc-go modules/apps/rate-limiting/types/msgs.go:50 — validation accepts channel-{N} format or any valid client-id */}
* MaxPercentSend: the outflow threshold as a percentage of the `channelValue`. {/* cosmos/ibc-go modules/apps/rate-limiting/types/quota.go:18 — threshold = totalValue.Mul(q.MaxPercentSend).Quo(100) */} More explicitly, a packet being sent would exceed the threshold quota if: (Outflow - Inflow + Packet Amount) / channelValue is greater than MaxPercentSend / 100 {/* cosmos/ibc-go modules/apps/rate-limiting/types/flow.go:35 — netOutflow := f.Outflow.Sub(f.Inflow).Add(amount) */}
* MaxPercentRecv: the inflow threshold as a percentage of the `channelValue` {/* cosmos/ibc-go modules/apps/rate-limiting/types/quota.go:16 — threshold = totalValue.Mul(q.MaxPercentRecv).Quo(100) */}
* DurationHours: the length of time, after which the rate limits reset {/* cosmos/ibc-go modules/apps/rate-limiting/keeper/abci.go:8 — BeginBlocker resets rate limits whose DurationHours epoch has elapsed */}

## Updating, Removing or Resetting Rate Limits

* If rate limits were set to be too low or high for a given channel/client, they can be updated with [`MsgUpdateRateLimit`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/main/modules/apps/rate-limiting/types/msgs.go#L81-L89). {/* cosmos/ibc-go modules/apps/rate-limiting/types/msgs.go:81 */}
* If rate limits are no longer needed, they can be removed with [`MsgRemoveRateLimit`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/main/modules/apps/rate-limiting/types/msgs.go#L135-L140). {/* cosmos/ibc-go modules/apps/rate-limiting/types/msgs.go:135 */}
* If the flow counter needs to be reset for a given rate limit, it is possible to do so with [`MsgResetRateLimit`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/main/modules/apps/rate-limiting/types/msgs.go#L167-L172). {/* cosmos/ibc-go modules/apps/rate-limiting/types/msgs.go:167 */}
