# Synopsis

This standard document specifies packet data structure, state machine handling logic, and encoding details for Cross-Chain Validation (CCV). CCV is the specific IBC level protocol that enables *Interchain Security*, a Cosmos-specific category of *Shared Security*.

At a high level, CCV enables a *provider chain* (e.g., the Cosmos Hub) to provide *security* to multiple *consumer chains*. This means that the validator sets on the consumer chains are chosen from the validator set of the provider chain (for more details, see the [Security Model](/ibc/v10.1.x/spec/app/ics-028-cross-chain-validation/overview_and_basic_concepts#security-model) section).

The communication between the provider and the consumer chains is done through the IBC protocol over a *unique*, *ordered* channel (one for each consumer chain). 

> Throughout this document, we will use the terms chain and blockchain interchangeably.
