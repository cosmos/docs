description: "Cosmos EVM is an open-source platform for teams building their own chain, rollup, or EVM-compatible application. It offers the industry's leading Layer 1 stack with custom modules, instant finality, and a native interoperability layer. With Cosmos EVM, you maintain full ownership of your entire stackâ€”from the application layer down to consensus."

## Why Cosmos EVM

Cosmos EVM provides a production-ready foundation for building EVM-compatible blockchains with the full power of the Cosmos SDK. The repository includes `evmd`, a fully functional reference implementation that serves as the canonical starting point for teams launching their own chains.

### Complete EVM Compatibility

From a developer's perspective, chains built with Cosmos EVM are **indistinguishable from canonical EVM chains** like Ethereum mainnet. Your existing tooling, workflows, and even AI coding assistants work without modification:

- **Deploy contracts** using Hardhat, Foundry, or Remix exactly as you would on Ethereum
- **Connect wallets** like MetaMask, WalletConnect, or Rabby without custom configuration
- **Use standard libraries** such as ethers.js, viem, and web3.js with zero changes
- **AI tools work seamlessly** - Claude, ChatGPT, and other AI assistants treat your local testnet as if it's Ethereum mainnet, deploying contracts and interacting with them using standard Ethereum patterns

All user-facing components are identical. The difference lies in what happens under the hood: instant finality, native IBC interoperability, and direct access to Cosmos SDK modules from your smart contracts.
