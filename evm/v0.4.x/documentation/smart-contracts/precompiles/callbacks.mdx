## Overview

The Callbacks module provides a standardized interface for smart contracts to handle IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) packet lifecycle events. This allows contracts to implement callback functions that are invoked when packets are acknowledged or time out during cross-chain communication.

This is not a precompile that is called directly, but rather an interface that a contract must implement to receive callbacks.

**Related Module**: [x/ibc-callbacks](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/main/modules/apps/callbacks/README.md)

## Callback Functions

A contract that sends an IBC transfer may need to listen for the outcome of the packet lifecycle. `Ack` and `Timeout` callbacks allow contracts to execute custom logic on the basis of how the packet lifecycle completes. The sender of an IBC transfer packet may specify a contract to be called when the packet lifecycle completes. This contract must implement the expected entrypoints for `onPacketAcknowledgement` and `onPacketTimeout`.

Critically, **only the IBC packet sender can set the callback**.

### `onPacketAcknowledgement`

**Signature**: `onPacketAcknowledgement(string memory channelId, string memory portId, uint64 sequence, bytes memory data, bytes memory acknowledgement)`

**Description**: Callback function invoked on the source chain after a packet lifecycle is completed and acknowledgement is processed. The contract implementing this interface receives packet information and acknowledgement data to execute custom callback logic.

### `onPacketTimeout`

**Signature**: `onPacketTimeout(string memory channelId, string memory portId, uint64 sequence, bytes memory data)`

**Description**: Callback function invoked on the source chain after a packet lifecycle is completed and the packet has timed out. The contract implementing this interface receives packet information to execute custom timeout handling logic.

## Security Considerations

When implementing the Callbacks interface, consider the following security aspects:

### Caller Validation
- **Critical**: Only the IBC module should invoke these callback functions
- Implementing contracts must validate that the caller is the authorized IBC module address
- Failure to validate the caller could allow malicious actors to trigger callbacks

### Gas Considerations
- Callback execution consumes gas from the IBC transaction
- Complex callback logic may cause the transaction to run out of gas
- Consider implementing gas-efficient callback logic or handling partial execution states
- Be aware that callback failures may impact the overall IBC packet lifecycle

### Example Security Pattern
```solidity
contract SecureIBCCallback is ICallbacks {
    address constant IBC_MODULE = 0x...; // IBC module address
    
    modifier onlyIBC() {
        require(msg.sender == IBC_MODULE, "Unauthorized");
        _;
    }
    
    function onPacketAcknowledgement(...) external onlyIBC {
        // Callback logic
    }
    
    function onPacketTimeout(...) external onlyIBC {
        // Timeout logic
    }
}
```
