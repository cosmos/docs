## Client Integrations

Client libraries play a crucial role indevelopment by making it easier for developers interact with the underlying protocols. 
Well-made libraries abstract away complexities and provide optimized methods to allow developers to focus on their project rather than the network itself."

EthersJS and Web3JS are two most commonly used libraries in dApp development. Developer uses these libraries to interact with blockchain and query JSON-RPC data, for example. Additionally, both of these libraries contain utilities to aid in task like converting large numbers (BigNumber).

* [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/) is the latest JS library that aims to be a complete and compact library for interacting with the Ethereum Blockchain and its ecosystem.
