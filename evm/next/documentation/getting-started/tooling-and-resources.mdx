---

Cosmos EVM implements a complete Ethereum execution environment, so the standard development toolchain carries over without modification. You can use any of the EVM tools you already know; just point them at your chain's RPC endpoint and chain ID.

## Development Tools

The following tools are a few examples of the many tools that are available for development on Cosmos EVM:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org) | JavaScript/TypeScript-based framework with a flexible plugin system and Ethers.js integration. |
| [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh) | Rust-based toolkit with Solidity-native tests and fast execution. Includes `forge`, `cast`, `anvil`, and `chisel`. |
| [OpenZeppelin Contracts](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts) | Audited implementations of common standards — ERC-20, ERC-721, access control, and more. |

## Client Libraries

| Library | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/) | JS/TS library for contract interaction, transaction signing, and provider management. |
| [Viem](https://viem.sh) | TypeScript-first, tree-shakeable library for RPC calls, ABI encoding, and contract access. Used by Wagmi. |
| [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh) | React hooks for wallet connection, chain state, and contract reads/writes. Built on Viem. |
| [RainbowKit](https://www.rainbowkit.com) | React component library for wallet connection UI. Integrates with Wagmi. |
## Wallets

See the [quick-start guide](/evm/next/documentation/getting-started/build-a-chain/quick-start#connect-a-wallet) for a walkthrough of connecting MetaMask to a local chain. The following are a few examples of the many wallets that are available for development on Cosmos EVM:

| Wallet | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| [MetaMask](https://metamask.io) | Add network via Settings → Networks |
| [Rabby](https://rabby.io) | Add network via Settings → Networks |
| [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.com) | Standard WalletConnect integration |
| [Keplr](https://www.keplr.app) | Supports both Cosmos and Ethereum transaction formats |
| [Leap](https://www.leapwallet.io) | Supports both Cosmos and Ethereum transaction formats |
| Ledger | Compatible via MetaMask or other wallet interfaces |

To add a chain manually, you'll need: the network name, RPC URL (port 8545), chain ID, and currency symbol.

## Block Explorers

Cosmos EVM chains support two types of explorer: EVM explorers for Ethereum-formatted data and Cosmos explorers for Cosmos and IBC data. [Mintscan](https://mintscan.io) supports both but requires a custom integration.

| Explorer | Type | Link |
|----------|------|------|
| Blockscout | EVM | [GitHub](https://github.com/blockscout/blockscout) |
| Ping.pub | Cosmos | [GitHub](https://github.com/ping-pub/explorer) |
| BigDipper | Cosmos | [GitHub](https://github.com/forbole/big-dipper-2.0-cosmos) |

## Testing & Analysis

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) | Static analysis — detects common vulnerability patterns in Solidity. |
| [solidity-coverage](https://github.com/sc-forks/solidity-coverage) | Reports untested code branches. Works with Hardhat and Foundry. |
| [Echidna](https://github.com/crytic/echidna) | Property-based fuzzer for Solidity contracts. |
| [OpenZeppelin Test Helpers](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-test-helpers) | Time manipulation, event assertions, and revert testing for Hardhat/Mocha. |
