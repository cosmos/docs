## Prerequisites

You'll need a standard Go development environment:

- **Go 1.23.8+** - [Installation guide](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- **Git** - For repository management
- **Make** - For build commands
- **GCC/Build Tools** - Required for CGo compilation

<Note>
If you're new to Go development, ensure your `$GOPATH/bin` is in your system PATH. Most package managers (Homebrew, apt, pacman) handle this automatically.
</Note>

## Get the Code

Clone the [cosmos/evm](https://github.com/cosmos/evm) repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cosmos/evm.git
cd evm
```

Build and verify:

```bash
make install
evmd version
```

## Test Your Setup

The repository includes a development script that launches a fully configured local testnet:

```bash
./local_node.sh
```

This starts a validator node accessible at `http://localhost:8545` with all JSON-RPC namespaces enabled (chain ID: `262144`).

You can:
- Connect with MetaMask or other Ethereum wallets
- Interact via the [RPC Explorer](/evm/next/api-reference/ethereum-json-rpc/rpc-explorer)
- Use the [CLI](/evm/next/documentation/cosmos-sdk/cli.mdx) for consensus-layer operations

## Key Concepts

Before building your chain, familiarize yourself with:

**Precompiled Contracts** - [Precompiles](/evm/next/documentation/smart-contracts/precompiles) bridge EVM smart contracts with Cosmos SDK modules, enabling Solidity contracts to access staking, governance, IBC, and other native functionality.

**Cosmos SDK Modules** - Explore the [core modules](/evm/next/documentation/cosmos-sdk) that provide blockchain functionality:
- [Bank](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/modules/bank) - Token transfers and balances
- [Staking](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/modules/staking) - Validator delegation and rewards
- [Governance](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/modules/governance) - On-chain voting and proposals
- [Slashing](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/modules/slashing) - Validator penalty enforcement
- [Distribution](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/modules/distribution) - Fee and reward distribution

## Next Steps

With your development environment ready, you can start configuring the pre-launch parameters. To make the process more manageable, we will go through it in three sections:

1. **Pre-Genesis Configuration** - Set chain-id, token parameters and other values that are hard-coded.
2. **Genesis Configuration** - Initialize the chain and configure genesis.json parameters such as module configs, genesis token allocations, and validator set.
3. **Runtime Configuration** - Set up node-level settings and launch the network.

Proceed to the [Pre-Genesis & Genesis Setup](/evm/next/documentation/getting-started/build-a-chain/pre-genesis-and-genesis-setup) guide to begin customizing your chain's identity and parameters.

## Additional Configuration Resources

Throughout your configuration journey, refer to these resources:

- **[Configuration Reference](/evm/next/documentation/getting-started/build-a-chain/configuration-reference)** - Comprehensive command reference with examples for different configurations
- **[EVM Mempool Integration](/evm/next/documentation/getting-started/build-a-chain/additional-configuration/mempool-integration)** - Advanced mempool customization
- **[Predeployed Contracts](/evm/next/documentation/getting-started/build-a-chain/additional-configuration/predeployed-contracts)** - Deploy standard contracts at genesis
