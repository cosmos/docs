## The Problem

Traditional blockchain ecosystems with EVM support often have token fragmentation:

- Native tokens in the base blockchain format
- Wrapped tokens as ERC20 contracts
- IBC vouchers for cross-chain assets
- Multiple bridge token representations

This creates liquidity splitting, user confusion, and inefficient capital allocation.

## Single Token Representation v2 (STRv2)

STRv2 ensures each asset has exactly one canonical representation that automatically adapts to its usage context.

**Core Principle**: Each token exists in either Cosmos or EVM format at any given time, never both. The representation automatically switches based on where it's being used.

**Automatic Conversion**:
- Sending to Ethereum address → converts to ERC20
- Sending to Cosmos address → converts to native coin
- IBC transfer with EVM recipient → arrives as ERC20

## Token Pairs

A TokenPair links a Cosmos denomination with an ERC20 contract address:

```
Cosmos Coin (uatom) ←→ TokenPair ←→ ERC20 Contract (0x...)
```

**Native Cosmos Coins**:
- Start as Cosmos SDK coins (uatom, uosmo, etc.)
- Module deploys an ERC20 contract representation
- Conversions use mint/burn mechanism

**Existing ERC20 Tokens**:
- Start as deployed ERC20 contracts
- Module creates a Cosmos coin denomination
- Conversions use escrow/release mechanism

## Precompiled Contracts

Instead of traditional wrapped token contracts, STRv2 uses precompiled contracts - native code that appears as ERC20 to the EVM but executes at native speed.

**Native Precompiles**:
- Standard ERC20 interface (transfer, approve, balanceOf)
- Direct bank module integration
- No contract storage overhead
- Gas costs 10-100x lower than regular ERC20

**Dynamic Precompiles**:
- WERC20 interfaces with deposit/withdraw
- Runtime registration for custom tokens
- Module-specific features

## Conversion Mechanics

**Cosmos → ERC20**:
1. Coins escrowed in module account
2. ERC20 minted to recipient

**ERC20 → Cosmos**:
1. Tokens burned (if module-owned) or escrowed (if external)
2. Coins released from module account

Supply invariant maintained:
```
Total Supply = Cosmos Circulating + ERC20 Circulating + Module Escrow
```

## IBC Integration

STRv2 integrates with IBC through middleware that automatically converts based on recipient address type:

- Ethereum address recipient → convert to ERC20
- Cosmos address recipient → keep as native
- Missing token pair → create dynamically

This enables seamless cross-chain DeFi workflows where tokens can be received via IBC and immediately used in EVM contracts without manual conversion steps.

## Design Rationale

**Why Not Simple Wrapping?** Traditional wrapping (like WETH) requires manual wrap/unwrap steps, splits liquidity between native and wrapped versions, and adds gas overhead from extra contract calls.

**Why Precompiles?** Precompiles provide native execution speed with ERC20 compatibility, no storage overhead, and appear as regular tokens to contracts. This is only possible with chain-level integration.

**Why Automatic Conversion?** Removes manual steps, unifies liquidity into single pools per asset, and eliminates user errors from using wrong token representations.

## Security

**Module Ownership** (native coins): Module can mint/burn ERC20, ensuring 1:1 backing with no external control risks.

**External Ownership** (ERC20 origin): Original deployer retains control, module uses escrow mechanism, preserving contract upgradeability.

**Validation**: ERC20 contracts validated before registration with event log verification and balance checks.
