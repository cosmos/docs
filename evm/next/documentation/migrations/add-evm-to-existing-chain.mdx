title: "Adding EVM to an Existing Chain"
description: "Guide for integrating the EVM module into a running Cosmos chain post-genesis"
---

## Overview

This guide covers the essential configuration requirements to ensure a smooth transition from a standard Cosmos chain to an EVM-compatible chain.

<Info>
The integration process focuses on two key areas: account derivation and gas token configuration. These must be set before adding the EVM module to ensure compatibility with Ethereum tooling. If you're pre-genesis and may add Cosmos EVM in the future, we strongly recommend completing steps 1 and 2 now to avoid major migrations later.
</Info>

## Prerequisites

Before beginning the integration process, ensure you have:

- A running Cosmos SDK chain with governance enabled
- Access to modify the chain's configuration and codebase
- Understanding of your chain's current account derivation setup
- Knowledge of your gas token's decimal configuration

<Warning>
These changes require a coordinated chain upgrade via governance.
</Warning>

## 1) Address Derivation Setup

Proper address derivation is critical for ensuring compatibility with Ethereum wallets, CLI tools, and block explorers. This setup consists of two components that work together to generate Ethereum-compatible addresses on your Cosmos chain.

### Set Coin Type to 60

The coin type is part of the BIP44 public key derivation path and must be set to `60` ([Ethereum's standard](https://github.com/cosmos/evm/blob/f1f4c2aee76243f0ffe0dd444e05b9cb2ef9898b/crypto/hd/hdpath.go#L9)) for EVM compatibility. This ensures that wallets using standard Ethereum derivation paths can correctly generate keys for your chain.

**Configure in your chain's initialization:**

```go
// Set the coin type in your SDK config
config := sdk.GetConfig()
config.SetCoinType(60) // Ethereum's coin type
config.Seal()
```

**Reference implementation:** [evmd/config/bech32.go](https://github.com/cosmos/evm/blob/f1f4c2aee76243f0ffe0dd444e05b9cb2ef9898b/evmd/config/bech32.go#L34)

<Info>
The coin type must be set during chain initialization and before the SDK config is sealed.
</Info>

### Add EthSecp256k1 Key Type

The `EthSecp256k1` key type enables Ethereum-style address derivation, which uses the last 20 bytes of the public key rather than hashing and Bech32 encoding. This makes it possible to convert between `0x` prefixed addresses and Cosmos Bech32 addresses.

**Reference implementations:**
- Keyring options: [cmd/evmd/cmd/root.go](https://github.com/cosmos/evm/blob/f1f4c2aee76243f0ffe0dd444e05b9cb2ef9898b/evmd/cmd/evmd/cmd/root.go#L85)
- Encoding config in app.go: [evmd/app.go](https://github.com/cosmos/evm/blob/f1f4c2aee76243f0ffe0dd444e05b9cb2ef9898b/evmd/app.go#L214)
- Encoding config helper: [encoding/config.go](https://github.com/cosmos/evm/blob/f1f4c2aee76243f0ffe0dd444e05b9cb2ef9898b/encoding/config.go#L33)

### Why This Matters

The combination of coin type 60 and `EthSecp256k1` key type ensures:

- **Wallet Compatibility**: MetaMask, Ledger, and other Ethereum wallets work seamlessly
- **Address Conversion**: Users can easily convert between `0x` and Bech32 address formats
- **Tooling Support**: Ethereum development tools (Hardhat, Foundry, Remix) function correctly
- **Block Explorer Integration**: Standard Ethereum explorers can index and display transactions

---

## 2) Gas Token Decimals

Ethereum uses 18 decimals for its gas token (1 wei = 10^-18 ETH), and maintaining this standard is strongly preferred for EVM compatibility. The decimal configuration affects how gas prices are calculated and displayed across all Ethereum tooling.

### Option A: 18-Decimal Gas Token (Preferred)

If your chain already uses an 18-decimal token as the gas token, no additional configuration is needed. The EVM module will work natively with your existing token.

**Genesis configuration:**

```json
{
  "app_state": {
    "bank": {
      "denom_metadata": [
        {
          "base": "atoken",
          "display": "token",
          "name": "Token",
          "symbol": "TKN",
          "denom_units": [
            {
              "denom": "atoken",
              "exponent": 0
            },
            {
              "denom": "token",
              "exponent": 18
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Option B: Non-18-Decimal Token with PreciseBank

For chains with non-18-decimal gas tokens (e.g., 6 decimals like `uatom`), use the [`x/precisebank`](https://github.com/cosmos/evm/tree/main/x/precisebank) module to track fractional balances at the EVM level while maintaining the native denomination for Cosmos transactions.

The `precisebank` module wraps the standard `bank` module and stores fractional balances separately. For example, if someone transfers 0.5 × 10^-6 tokens (less than 1 `uatom`) via an EVM transaction, precisebank tracks this fractional amount even though the base denomination can't represent it.

### Decimal Configuration Summary

| Token Type | Configuration | Module Required |
|------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 18-decimal native token | Standard setup | None |
| Non-18-decimal token | ExtendedDenomOptions + precisebank | `x/precisebank` |

## 3) Upgrade Handler Implementation

After configuring address derivation and gas token decimals, implement an upgrade handler to add the EVM module to your running chain.

<Info>
Refer to the [upgrade handlers documentation](./upgrade-handlers) for more details on implementing and testing upgrade handlers.
</Info>

---

## 4) Testing and Validation

Before proposing the upgrade on mainnet, thoroughly test on a testnet or local network.

### Pre-Upgrade Checklist

- Coin type set to 60
- EthSecp256k1 added to keyring and signing options
- Gas token decimal configuration determined (18-decimal native or precisebank)
- Upgrade handler implemented and tested

### Post-Upgrade Validation

After the upgrade executes:

1. **Verify address derivation:**
   ```bash
   # Create a new key with eth_secp256k1
   <binary> keys add test-key --keyring-backend test --algo eth_secp256k1

   # Verify the address format matches Ethereum expectations
   ```

2. **Test EVM transactions:**
   ```bash
   # Send a simple EVM transaction
   # Verify it processes correctly and gas is calculated in wei
   ```

3. **Check module parameters:**
   ```bash
   <binary> query vm params
   <binary> query feemarket params
   ```

## Key Considerations

### Chain Halt Risk

<Warning>
Improper configuration can cause consensus failures. Always test the complete upgrade process on a testnet that mirrors your mainnet state before proposing the governance upgrade.
</Warning>

### Account Migration

Existing accounts on your chain will continue to work after adding the EVM module. However:

- Legacy accounts using `secp256k1` keys can still interact with Cosmos SDK modules
- New EVM-compatible accounts should be created with `eth_secp256k1` keys

### Existing Balances

Token balances are preserved during the upgrade:

- For 18-decimal tokens: No migration needed
- For non-18-decimal tokens: Existing balances remain unchanged in the Cosmos SDK, but EVM interactions will use the precisebank wrapper for fractional precision
